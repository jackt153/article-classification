https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51048366,Coronavirus symptoms: What are they and how do I protect myself?,"Coronavirus has claimed more than 106,000 lives and infected more than 1.7m people around the world. Among them is UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is recovering in hospital after being treated in intensive care for Covid-19. Coronavirus infects the lungs. The two main symptoms are a fever and a dry cough, which can sometimes lead to breathing problems. The cough to look out for is a new, continuous cough. This means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or having three or more coughing episodes in 24 hours. If you usually have a cough, it may be worse than usual. You have a fever if your temperature is above 37.8C. This can make you feel warm, cold or shivery. A sore throat, headache and diarrhoea have also been reported and a loss of smell and taste may also be a symptom. It takes five days on average to start showing the symptoms, but some people will get them much later. The World Health Organization (WHO) says the incubation period lasts up to 14 days. The majority of people with coronavirus will recover after rest and pain relief (such as paracetamol). The main reason people need hospital treatment is difficulty breathing. Doctors may scan the lungs to see how badly they are affected and give support, such as oxygen or ventilation, if needed. However, people should not go to A&E if they are concerned. In the UK, the NHS 111 website will guide you through what to do. If you are so breathless that you are unable to speak more than a few words you will be told to call 999, as this is a medical emergency. If you become so ill that you've stopped doing all of your usual daily activities then it will advise speaking to a nurse by dialling NHS 111. Intensive care units (ICUs) are specialist wards for people who are very ill. Coronavirus patients will get oxygen support, which can involve using a facemask, or a tube in the nose. The most invasive way - for the most seriously ill patients - is ventilation where air, with increased levels of oxygen, is pushed into the lungs via a tube in the mouth, nose or through a small cut in the throat. Patients with mild symptoms should self-isolate at home for at least seven days. People are advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried. They should also not go to their GP, or A&E. Details for Scotland are to check NHS inform, then ring your GP in office hours, or 111 out-of-hours. In Wales call NHS 111, and in Northern Ireland, call your GP. If you have come into contact with somebody who may be infected, you may be told to self-isolate. The World Health Organization has also issued advice for the public. The proportion dying from the disease appears low (between 1% and 2%) - but the figures are unreliable. Thousands are being treated but may go on to die - so the death rate could be higher. But it may also be lower if lots of mild cases are unreported. A World Health Organization (WHO) examination of data from 56,000 patients suggests: Older people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure), are more likely to become severely ill. Men are at slightly higher risk of dying from the virus than women. Work to develop a vaccine is under way. The best thing is regular and thorough hand washing, preferably with soap and water. Coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can be breathed in, or cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on, then your eyes, nose or mouth. So, coughing and sneezing into tissues, not touching your face with unwashed hands, and avoiding close contact with infected people are important. People will be most infectious when they have symptoms, but some may spread the virus even before they are sick. Face masks do not provide effective protection, according to medical experts. However, the WHO is re-examining whether the public might benefit from using them. Follow James on Twitter.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52269426,Coronavirus: Gown supply 'critically low' in some hospitals,"An NHS boss has warned the number of protective gowns available to front-line staff in parts of the country has become critically low in recent days. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers in England, has called for a more sustainable supply of gowns, which are imported from China. On Sunday, the health secretary said the amount of available PPE - personal protective equipment - was increasing. It came as deaths in UK hospitals rose to 11,329 - up by 717 since Sunday. The Department of Health said a further 4,342 people had tested positive for coronavirus as of 09:00 BST on Monday. Meanwhile, a review of the UK's lockdown measures will take place later this week. Mr Hopson, from NHS Providers in England which represents hospital trusts, told BBC Breakfast that the number of protective gowns available to NHS staff in some parts of the country was very, very low. Mr Hopson said that the NHS ordered a whole load of stock weeks ago, but delays have been caused by the gowns sometimes failing safety tests, while other batches have been mislabelled - meaning the NHS has ended up with additional masks. He added: If everything had been flowing exactly as had been ordered and if all of the material had properly passed its safety test, there would not be an issue. This is all really hand-to-mouth in terms of gown delivery, and we need to get to a more sustainable supply. At the government's daily briefing on Sunday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government was working night and day to make sure we get the right PPE. I'm glad to say there are now record amounts [of PPE] in the system, he said, adding: Daily we're delivering millions of items to the frontline. On gowns, he said: In the last two days 121,000 gowns have been delivered around the country and more are going out today and in the week to come. Mr Hopson said that the vast majority of preparations for the outbreak within the NHS had gone well, with nearly all stocks of PPE flowing in the way that trusts would like. The bit where there's a particular problem was gowns, he said. We know that over the last 72 hours some trusts have run critically low on gowns. No trust, as far as I'm aware, has actually run out but some of the stocks are very, very low. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has confirmed public services will receive more than £14bn from the government's coronavirus emergency response fund, including more than £6bn for health services. The Treasury said the funding would go towards freeing up hospital beds and delivering urgent priorities such as acquiring ventilators, diagnostic tests and protective equipment for NHS staff. A gown is a piece of PPE used to protect the body of those who might come into contact with coronavirus. It should be made of water-resistant material and have long sleeves. If the gown is not water resistant, a waterproof apron is needed underneath to protect the wearer from droplets containing the virus. The World Health Organization says gowns should be worn by all doctors, nurses and cleaners who enter coronavirus patients' rooms in hospitals. They should also be used by those handling coronavirus samples in labs and healthcare workers, cleaners and ambulance crews in places where patients with suspected coronavirus symptoms are seen. It comes as Downing Street denied that cabinet minister Michael Gove's daughter being tested for coronavirus was an example of double standards. Tests are not yet available for most people and mainly reserved for seriously ill patients in hospital. The prime minister's spokesman said the test was carried out on the advice of the chief medical officer and in line with medical guidance. The spokesman said Mr Gove's job is a central role in the government's response and the test meant he could get back to work. Latest government figures show 18,000 tests were carried out on Saturday. There are 23 drive-through testing sites now open for NHS staff, No 10 said. Meanwhile, No 10 has said Mr Johnson will recover at Chequers - the PM's official country residence - as it was considered to be a suitable place. The spokesman added Mr Johnson will not be carrying out government work. Mr Raab is currently in charge of running the government. On Sunday, Mr Johnson thanked NHS staff after being discharged from hospital in London, where he was being treated for Covid-19 - the disease caused by the coronavirus. It is unclear whether the prime minister will take part in the lockdown review, which is due to be carried out by Thursday. Wales' health minister said last week that the lockdown would remain for several more weeks at the very least. And Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned there was no likelihood or prospect of measures being lifted after the Easter weekend. NHS England said on Monday that a further 667 patients with coronavirus had died in the country, while a further 15 deaths were recorded in Wales, and a further nine in Scotland. Recently widowed Hannah - not her real name - has told how her husband of more than 40 years died after contracting coronavirus. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that her husband was in hospital for about a week before he died, and was put on a CPAP machine, which delivers oxygen to the lungs without needing a ventilator, to aid his breathing during that time. Describing his death, she said his breathing was really laboured. It is not a nice, quiet way to go, she said. Hannah added: This is such a cruel disease. Apart from the medical staff that he saw when he had to, [my husband] was alone for a week. Wendy's father fell ill with coronavirus around a month ago and he has now been taken off a ventilator in hospital. They've given him medication to keep him calm and relaxed and it is a matter of just waiting now for him to fade away peacefully, she told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire. The nurses are with him, they are holding his hand, they've been absolutely marvellous, Wendy added. We had to make the decision for the ventilator to be removed and for him to pass away peacefully. Sam Monaghan, the head of the UK's largest charity care provider MHA, told BBC Breakfast that about 150 of its residents had died with confirmed or suspected coronavirus, as well as two staff members. It comes as 12 residents of a County Durham care home have now died after displaying symptoms of coronavirus. In other developments: Have you been affected by the coronavirus?

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-52212579,What were the most-played songs of the 2010s?,"Aah, the 2010s... Do you remember them? Back in that golden age when we were all still able to listen to music in bars, cafes, shops, stadiums, at the gym and (sometimes) even at the office. Now with the first Easter of the 2020s on lockdown, PPL and BBC Radio 2 can reveal the top 40 most-played songs on UK TV and radio, of the last decade. DJ Scott Mills will countdown the list of absolute bangers - led by Adele and Bruno Mars, with three appearances each - on the station on Monday. The top 40 most-played songs are the sounds that radio producers and broadcasters have consistently played throughout the last decade and will evoke many memories for all of us, said Peter Leathem, boss of the music licensing company which compiled the chart. Jeff Smith, head of music at Radio 2, added it's packed with universally loved, sing-along pop hits that really do stand the test of time. The new data suggests broadcasters mostly favoured songs by male solo artists, with 22 nods compared to 14 solo female tracks, while American stars outweighed home-grown performers by 18-14. Bands and groups accounted for 12 of the tracks, while that most modern phenomenon of the collab yielded seven hits. And British outlets, it seems, also preferred to give airtime to songs released that decade (34 out of 40), with just a few from the noughties and Natalie Imbruglia flying the flag for the 1990s on her own, with Torn. Rihanna, Coldplay, Lady Gaga and Katy Perry all made the top 40, however that's the last you'll be hearing of that lot in this article. Because we're about to dip straight into the top 10, which features two Brits, two women and two Pharrells. The top 10 most-played songs of the 2010s on UK TV and radio: End of Youtube post by kingsofleonVEVO First up, pop pickers, is a song that you've almost certainly heard a wedding covers band butcher since its release in 2008. It gave the Nashville guitar slingers their first UK number one, and their first Grammy win too, for best rock performance by a group. In 2017, they told Radio X how they would one day explain the song's saucy lyrical content to their kids. It's Socks on Fire, said drummer Nathan Followill. Uncle Caleb's socks caught on fire one night when I was drying them out on the heater. Use Somebody, another track off their fourth album, Only by the Night, also made the top 40. End of Youtube post by CeeLo Green As many of you will have noticed, this is actually the broadcast-friendly version of the Atlanta singer's 2010 track, written in collaboration with Bruno Mars and several others. The song, which was a dig at the music industry, ironically won him a Grammy award for best urban/alternative performance. Billboard reviewed it at the time as sounding as sunny as a '60s Motown hit and as expletive-laden as an early Eminem song. CeeLo was last seen, or heard rather, performing as the monster on the surreal ITV show The Masked Singer. End of Youtube post by OneRepublicVEVO The US pop-rock band topped the UK charts for the first time in 2013 with Counting Stars, which frontman and songwriter Ryan Tedder penned when he was trying to come up with something for Beyonce (who is notably absent from this chart). The song's accompanying video has now been viewed well over 2.9 billion times on YouTube, making it the streaming site's 14th most-viewed video ever. Not enough music videos contain crocodiles these days, do they? End of Youtube post by MarkRonsonVEVO The second biggest-selling song of the decade - on streaming and physical sales - is also the second big royalty cheque on this list for the Mars man, and gives us our first Brit too. London-born US producer/DJ Ronson, and the Hawaiian singer bagged the Brit award for best British single for Uptown Funk in 2015, when it felt like it was never off the speakers, anywhere. Fun fact: after its release though, they were legally made to credit The Gap Band as co-writers, due to the song's resemblance to the their 1979 party hit, Oops Up Side Your Head. Bruno's other songs, Locked out of Heaven, and Just the Way You Are, also appear on the top 40. End of Youtube post by BlackEyedPeasVEVO Tonight's the night / Let's live it up sang B.E.P in their 2009 hit, and I'm sure we all intend to follow that advice if we're ever allowed out again. The track was produced by superstar French DJ David Guetta and arguably saw them both at the peak of their powers. After singer Fergie left in 2015, the band went on to perform the song as part of a medley before the 2017 Champions League Final in Cardiff. However, the performance, which included fireworks, ran over time and forced the kick-off to be delayed by several minutes. Fair to say they've had better nights. End of Youtube post by justintimberlakeVEVO As well as singing the film Trolls' lead song, JT played the worrywart Branch in the DreamWorks animation. In an interview with TheWrap, he said, like his character, he was pulling his hair out over the prospect of producing a hit for some colourful mythical creatures. This wasn't just like writing a song for a movie - it was writing a song for characters that are going to sing it in the movie, he said. That part had to work, and that's the part that made it a task that none of us had ever done. He needn't have worried, as the song - which he debuted live at the Eurovision song contest - won the Grammy Award for best song written for visual media. Having been released in 2016, this is actually the most recent track in the top 10, which is weighted in favour of older songs - because its surveying plays over a whole decade - and perhaps helps to solve the mystery of the missing Ed. Sheeran's stellar 2017 track, Shape of You, came in in 38th. End of Youtube post by DaftPunkVEVO Combining the musical might of the French electronic duo, the US hip-hop star and the legendary guitarist, it was only ever going to end one way, wasn't it? Choon. Stevie Wonder even added to the talent pool by joining them on-stage to perform the modern disco-hit at the 2014 Grammys, where it won record of the year and best pop group performance. It topped almost every chart in the world, selling a million equivalent copies in the UK in just 69 days. When I think how it happened, too, with people who I like a lot, that we just decided to go into the studio and do something, Rodgers told the Official Chart Company. And then it turns out like this? It's absolutely remarkable, because no-one was prepared for this! While attempting to Get Lucky is very much against current government guidelines, dancing around your kitchen to that funky bass-line is not. End of Youtube post by Maroon5VEVO Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine attempted to brighten up one of the dullest Super Bowls in recent history by going topless as sang this ode to his hip-thrusting abilities, last year in Atlanta. The 2010 track peaked at number two in the UK but topped the US charts, meaning Christina Aguilera became only the fifth female to score number one singles in three different decades, after Janet Jackson, Madonna, Spears and Cher. But it still wasn't enough for her to get invited back to the greatest show on earth to perform. Incidentally, last year, Sir Mick Jagger - the 76-year-old Rolling Stone referenced in the song's title - posted a video of himself dancing at home following heart surgery, to prove he still had his signature moves. The Los Angeles band's other big hit of the decade, Payphone - featuring rapper Wiz Khalifa - also gets a mention in the top 40. End of Youtube post by AdeleVEVO The opener from Adele's Brit award-winning second album, 21, was essentially her big comeback track following the breakthrough success of her debut, and also the moment she became a real star in the States too. The gospel-tinged vibes of the pounding 2010 track saw her pick up three Grammys - record and song of the year, plus best short-form music video. The visuals found her alone in an abandoned room which soon began to fall apart, like the relationship she was singing about. After Mark Ronson, the Londoner is the only other British-born artist (and second woman) to appear in the top 10... and he mostly grew up in New York. Someone Like You and Set Fire to the Rain, from the same blockbuster album, also made the top 40 mix. End of Youtube post by PharrellWilliamsVEVO So there you have it! An upbeat and inoffensive top 10. The appearance of Mr Williams' second ubiquitous earworm of the 2010s confirms there is no room at all at the top table for Drake, Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber or Ariana Grande. Possibly as while they are popular with younger audiences, radio and TV has to appeal to a much broader listenership. Happy was another track written for an animated film; namely Despicable Me 2, and it fast became the eighth biggest-selling song in UK chart history. A live rendition of the song eventually scored the singer/rapper a Grammy, after he previously lost out in the best original song category to Let it Go, from Disney's Frozen. When they read the results, my face was... frozen, Pharrell told GQ magazine. But then I thought about it, and I just decided just to... let it go. With Lucky and Happy enjoying great success, we look forward to seeing which of the remaining seven dwarves he'll name his hits after in this new era. (Joke... we know Lucky isn't one really).

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-50435014,"Cryptoqueen: How this woman scammed the world, then vanished","Ruja Ignatova called herself the Cryptoqueen. She told people she had invented a cryptocurrency to rival Bitcoin, and persuaded them to invest billions. Then, two years ago, she disappeared. Jamie Bartlett spent months investigating how she did it for the Missing Cryptoqueen podcast, and trying to figure out where she's hiding. In early June 2016 a 36-year-old businesswoman called Dr Ruja Ignatova walked on stage at Wembley Arena in front of thousands of adoring fans. She was dressed, as usual, in an expensive ballgown, wearing long diamond earrings and bright red lipstick. She told the cheering crowd that OneCoin was on course to become the world's biggest cryptocurrency for everyone to make payments everywhere. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and is still the biggest and best-known - its rise in value from a few cents to hundreds of dollars per coin by mid-2016 had given rise to a frenzy of excitement among investors. Cryptocurrency as an idea was just entering the mainstream. Lots of people were looking to get involved in this strange new opportunity. OneCoin, Dr Ruja told the Wembley audience, was the Bitcoin Killer. In two years, nobody will speak about Bitcoin any more! she shouted. All over the world, people were already investing their savings into OneCoin, hoping to be part of this new revolution. Documents leaked to the BBC show that British people spent almost €30m on OneCoin in the first six months of 2016, €2m of it in a single week - and the rate of investment could have increased after the Wembley extravaganza. Between August 2014 and March 2017 more than €4bn was invested in dozens of countries. From Pakistan to Brazil, from Hong Kong to Norway, from Canada to Yemen… even Palestine. But there was something very important these investors didn't know. To explain this, I need first to explain briefly how a cryptocurrency actually works. This is notoriously difficult - go online and you'll find hundreds of different descriptions, some of them utterly baffling to the non-specialist. But this is the first principle to grasp: money is only valuable because other people think it's valuable. Whether it's Bank of England notes and coins, shells, precious stones or matchsticks - all of which have historically been used as money - it only works when everyone trusts it. For a long time, people have tried to create a form of digital money independent of state-backed currencies. But they have always failed because no-one could trust them. They would always need someone in charge who could manipulate the supply, and forgery was too easy. The reason so many people are excited by Bitcoin is that it solves that problem. It depends upon a special type of database called a blockchain, which is like a huge book - one that Bitcoin owners have independent but identical copies of. Every time a Bitcoin is sent from me to someone else, a record of that transaction goes into everyone's book. Nobody - not banks, not governments, or the person who invents it - is in charge or can change it. There is some very clever maths behind all this, but this means that Bitcoins can't be faked, they can't be hacked and can't be double-spent. (I tested this explanation on my mother, the family technophobe, and she told me I'd failed to make it clear enough and should start again. So don't worry too much if you don't follow it either.) The key point is that these special blockchain databases are what make cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin work. For its fans this is a revolutionary new form of currency, with the potential to sideline the banks and national currencies, and provide banking for anyone with a mobile phone. And if you get in early, there's the chance to make a fortune. Dr Ruja's genius was to take all of this and sell the idea to the masses. But there was something wrong. In early October 2016 - four months after Dr Ruja's London appearance - a blockchain expert called Bjorn Bjercke was called by a recruitment agent, with a curious job offer. A cryptocurrency start-up from Bulgaria was looking for a chief technical officer. Bjercke would get an apartment and a car - and an attractive annual salary of about £250,000. I was thinking: 'What is my job going to be? What are the things that I'm going to have to do for this company?' he recalls. And he said: 'Well, first of all, they need a blockchain. They don't have a blockchain today.' I said: 'What? You told me it was a cryptocurrency company.' The agent replied that this was correct. It was a cryptocurrency company, and it had been running for a while - but it didn't have a blockchain. So we need you to build a blockchain, he went on. What's the name of the company? asked Bjercke. It's OneCoin. He didn't take the job. One spring day a few months earlier, Jen McAdam received a message from a friend about an unmissable investment opportunity. Sitting at her computer, the Glaswegian clicked on a link and joined a OneCoin webinar. Over the next hour or so she listened carefully to people talking enthusiastically about this exciting new cryptocurrency - how it could transform her fortunes. All of them were very up-tempo, full of beans, full of passion, she remembers. You are so lucky that you're seeing this webinar right now, she was told. You're in at such an early stage and it's just going to go like Bitcoin. It's going to go bigger. The webinar hosts talked about Dr Ruja's glittering background: Oxford University, a PhD from Konstanz, a stint with the respected management consultancy, McKinsey and Company... A speech Dr Ruja had given at a conference hosted by The Economist magazine was shown - and that's what clinched it for McAdam. That ticked a box... The power of the woman - well done! I felt proud of her. By the time the webinar had finished she had decided to invest €1,000. It was easy: you purchased OneCoin tokens, and these then generated coins, which went into your account. One day soon, she was told, she would be able to turn these coins back into euros or pounds. It seemed like easy money. Maybe €1,000 wasn't enough? The promoters said it was the larger packages that were really life-changing. The smallest package cost €140, but they went all the way up to €118,000. One week later McAdam bought a tycoon package, for €5,000. Before long, she had invested €10,000 of her own money - and persuaded friends and family to invest €250,000 of theirs. She watched excitedly on the OneCoin website as the value of her coins steadily rose. Before too long they had passed £100,000 - a 10-fold return. She started planning holidays and shopping trips. But towards the end of the year Jen McAdam was contacted by a stranger on the internet. He claimed to be a good Samaritan, someone who had studied OneCoin carefully and wanted to speak to people who had invested. Reluctantly, she agreed to a conversation on Skype. It turned out to be a shouting match, but it would send McAdam's life in a new direction. The stranger was Timothy Curry, a Bitcoin enthusiast and cryptocurrency advocate. He thought OneCoin would give cryptocurrencies a bad name, and he told McAdam bluntly that it was a scam - the biggest scam in the [expletive] world. He said he could prove it, too. Well then prove it to me! she replied, sharply. Over the next several weeks, Curry sent a stream of information about how cryptocurrencies work: links, articles, YouTube videos. He introduced her to Bjorn Bjercke, the blockchain developer who said there was no blockchain. It took McAdam three months to go through it all, but questions were starting to form. She started asking the leaders of her OneCoin group if there was a blockchain. At first she was told it was something she didn't need to know, but when she persisted she finally got the truth in a voicemail in April 2017. OK Jen… they don't want to disclose that kind of information, just in case something goes wrong where the blockchain is being held. And plus, as an application, it doesn't need a server behind it. So it's our blockchain technology, a SQL server with a database. But by this stage, thanks to Curry and Bjercke, she knew that a standard SQL server database was no basis for a genuine cryptocurrency. The manager of the database could go in and change it at will. I thought, 'What???' And literally my legs just went, and I fell on the floor,' she says. The inescapable conclusion was that those rising numbers on the OneCoin website were meaningless - they were just numbers typed into a computer by a OneCoin employee. Far from putting an end to their financial worries, she and her friends and family had thrown a quarter of a million euros away. Although Jen McAdam had now seen the light, few other OneCoin investors had. Dr Ruja was still travelling the world to sell her vision - hopping from Macau to Dubai to Singapore, filling out arenas, pulling in new investors. OneCoin was still growing fast, and Dr Ruja was starting to spend her new fortune: buying multi-million-dollar properties in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, and the Black Sea resort of Sozopol. In her downtime she would throw parties on her luxurious yacht The Davina. At one, in July 2017, the American pop star Bebe Rexha performed a private set. Despite the successful facade, trouble was brewing. The opening of a long-promised exchange that would allow OneCoin to be turned into cash kept being delayed - and investors were growing more and more concerned. This was to be resolved at a large gathering of European OneCoin promoters in Lisbon, Portugal, in October 2017. But when the day came, Dr Ruja - who was famously punctual - didn't show up. She was on her way. Nobody knew why she wasn't there, recalls one delegate. Frantic calls and messages went unanswered. The head office in Sofia, where she was such an imposing presence, didn't know anything either. Dr Ruja had vanished. Some feared she'd been killed or kidnapped by the banks, who - they'd been told - had most to fear from the cryptocurrency revolution. In fact, she had gone underground. FBI records presented in court documents earlier this year indicate that on 25 October 2017, just two weeks after her Lisbon no-show, she boarded a Ryanair flight from Sofia to Athens. And then went completely off radar. That was the last time anyone saw or heard from Dr Ruja. Igor Alberts is wearing black-and-gold everything. Black-and-gold shoes, black-and-gold pleated suit, black-and-gold shirt, black-and-gold sunglasses, and he has a thick black-and-gold ring on. And every item of clothing is Dolce and Gabbana. When you look at my clothes, they are disciplined, he says. His wife, Andreea Cimbala, nods along, adding that if he wakes up and puts on pink underwear, he sticks to pink as he chooses his shirt, trousers and jacket. They live in an enormous house in an affluent neighbourhood on the outskirts of Amsterdam. At the gated entrance to their mansion is a 10ft-high wrought iron gate with their names and the slogan What dreams may come. A Maserati and Aston Martin are parked outside. Alberts was brought up in a poor neighbourhood. Then he got into network marketing, or multi-level marketing (MLM) as it is often known, and started making money. Lots of money. He claims he has made €100m over the last 30 years. Here is how multi-level marketing works. I pay £100 to start selling vitamin tablets directly to people. I sell a box to my friends, Georgia and Phil, and make a small cut. But then I recruit Georgia and Phil to start selling too, and I make a cut on their sales as well. They are now in what's called my downline. Phil and Georgia both recruit two people, and then all four of them recruit two more, and so on. This mushrooms very rapidly - 25 rounds of recruitment later and everyone in the UK would be selling vitamins. (And I, at the top, would be making a cut on all the sales.) MLM is not illegal. Big companies like Amway and Herbalife use these techniques. But it is controversial, because usually only a small number of people make all the money. It's also notorious for exaggerated promises of high earnings and tough sales targets. When there is nothing of value to sell, though, and all the money is made by recruiting other people, it is illegal and goes by another name: a pyramid scheme. In May 2015, already a very successful MLM seller, Igor Alberts was invited to a OneCoin event in Dubai, where he met lots of people, all apparently making fortunes with this new currency. Dr Ruja herself made a powerful impression too, with her princess's dresses and her vision of a financial revolution. Igor returned with a new mission - and gave new instructions to all the salespeople in his downline: stop whatever you're doing, and start selling OneCoin. We gathered the teams together and we started to work like crazy, he says. We made in our first month almost €90,000 out of nothing. Bang! Dr Ruja's genius was to recognise that established MLM sellers with huge downlines were the perfect vehicle to market her fake coin - a plan the FBI says she privately referred to as the bitch of Wall Street, meets MLM. This was the secret of OneCoin's success. It wasn't just a fake cryptocurrency, it was an old-fashioned pyramid scheme, with the fake coin as its product. No wonder it spread like wildfire. Fairly soon Igor Alberts was making more than €1m a month from OneCoin, which quickly became the biggest product in network marketing. No other company even came close, Alberts says. Sixty per cent of the income Igor Alberts and Andreea Cimbala made from OneCoin (in the end, more than €2m per month) was paid in cash, the rest in OneCoin. But they used some of this cash to buy more OneCoin. They, like almost everyone else involved, were convinced they were earning a fortune. I did the calculation how many coins we needed to become the richest person on the planet, Igor says. I said to Andreea, 'We need to build it up to 100 million coins, because when this coin goes to €100 and we have 100 million, we are richer than Bill Gates.' It's mathematic. It's easy as that. The nature of MLM networks - where people often recruit others who are close to them - creates a blurred sense of responsibility. Blame is not easy to apportion. And if sellers have invested their own money, they are victims too. After Dr Ruja's non-appearance in Lisbon, a point came when Igor Alberts, like Jen McAdam, asked to see evidence of the blockchain. He didn't get it, and in December 2017 he quit. I ask if he felt guilty, for having sold so many people a coin that didn't exist, and for having made so much money in the process. I felt responsibility. Not guilt, he replies. You can never be blamed for believing in something. I had no clue that it could be false. I didn't even know what is a blockchain… What doubt can I have? He points out that he spent millions buying OneCoin, possibly more than anyone else. By contrast, Jen McAdam says she bears a heavy burden of guilt. I ask her how much she earned from selling OneCoin and she says it was €3,000 - €1,800 of which she received in cash, and which she used to buy more OneCoin. She feels guilty towards those who she introduced to OneCoin, she says, but also towards her late father, a miner, who worked hard all his life in horrible conditions, and left her the money that she then gave away. It's hard to know how much money has been put into OneCoin. Documents leaked to the BBC say €4bn between August 2014 and March 2017. I've also been told by more than one person that it could be as much as €15bn. There's a famous saying in journalism, Follow the money. So with Georgia Catt, producer of The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast, I went to see Oliver Bullough, an expert on what he calls Moneyland - the shadowy parallel world where criminals and the super-rich hide their wealth. The problem, he explains, is that following the money isn't as easy as it sounds, because criminals structure their companies and bank accounts in such a way that their assets seem to disappear. They still exist, he says, in his garden near the village of Hay-on-Wye. You can still use them to buy things, you can still use them to buy political influence and nice houses and yachts. But when it comes to someone trying to find them - whether that's a journalist or a police officer - they are invisible. It's no surprise, then, that OneCoin's corporate structure is incredibly complicated. Here's an example: Ruja bought a very large property in central Sofia. Technically it was owned by a company called One Property. One Property was owned by another company called Risk Ltd. Risk Ltd was owned by Ruja, but was then transferred to some unnamed Panamanians, but it was still managed by another company called Peragon. And Peragon was owned by another company called Artefix, which was owned by Ruja's mother, Veska. And then in 2017, the ownership of Artefix was sold to an unknown man in his 20s. Oliver describes this kind of dizzying arrangement as improbably standard. For several months, a French journalist called Maxime Grimbert tried to unpick OneCoin's corporate workings, collecting as many company names and bank account details as he could. I show his results to Bullough, who immediately notices how many British companies there are. British companies are the companies of choice, he comments. They're very easy to set up and they look legitimate. He takes the first one on the list and looks it up on the Companies House website. Everything is meant to be transparent - the website contains the details of every company in the UK. It's thought to be a key anti-corruption tool. We are very proud of this in this country, he says. The problem is that when you create this company, no-one checks any of the information provided. He clicks to see the company's filing history, but where you should see company accounts, there is nothing. This is classic, he exclaims. Look, nothing has happened. They have filed no financial information at all. Then he tries checking the company's owners. The UK began to insist recently that companies must enter the name of the person with significant control - the real owner. This is supposed to mean that you can no longer use a British company to hide behind, he says, as he scrolls down the page. Oh, hey presto, they haven't filed a person with significant control. That's illegal… That is an anonymous shell company, as anonymous as anything that you can buy anywhere in the Seychelles or Nevis or the Marshall Islands or Vanuatu. So much for following the money. In an interconnected global economy, assets can simply vanish, and you end up chasing shadows. Listen to The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast, with Jamie Bartlett and producer Georgia Catt, on BBC Sounds When you're dealing with a scam worth billions of euros, it's not unusual for shadowy groups to get involved. Several of the people Georgia and I interviewed spoke darkly about mysterious people and connections they didn't want to name. When you talk about the amount of money that's been put into OneCoin of course there's people out there who are pissed off and would do anything to shut anyone like me up, says Bjorn Bjercke, the blockchain expert who discovered there was no blockchain, and started talking about it publicly. He tells me he's received death threats as a result of speaking out. If I knew what I would have to go through, I would have never blown the whistle. I would have just turned my back and walked away, he says. When I ask him who might be behind the threats, he won't elaborate. I can't discuss that. It starts to get very very very scary, very very very fast. According to Bjercke, Dr Ruja never expected OneCoin to grow so big. People involved at the early stages have told him it was never supposed to be a billion-dollar scam. She tried to close it down, he says, but the dark forces wouldn't let her. Once OneCoin was running above 10 million, 20 million, 30 million, something happened where she was unable to stop it, Bjercke says. I think she was so scared in the fall of 2017 that she decided to skip. Igor Alberts, the MLM seller, also talks about the involvement of very influential people. When I ask for more details, he replies: No, I cannot tell that because I don't want to take that risk with our lives. It's not clear who Bjorn and Igor are talking about, or whether they are even talking about the same people, but the US Department of Justice claims to have evidence of a link between Dr Ruja's brother, Konstantin Ignatov - who took over the running of OneCoin when Ruja disappeared - and significant players in Eastern European organised crime. On 6 March 2019 Konstantin Ignatov was at Los Angeles International airport, waiting to fly back to Bulgaria after some OneCoin meetings in the US. Just as he was boarding his flight home, he was pounced on by FBI agents, arrested ,and charged with fraud in connection with OneCoin. Around the same time, the US authorities charged Dr Ruja in absentia for wire fraud, security fraud and money laundering. Amazingly, even after this, OneCoin continued to function - and people continued to invest in it. When Georgia and I visited Sofia a month later, Dr Ruja's personal mansion appeared to be locked up and empty, but the OneCoin office gave every appearance of being a busy workplace. Why have so many people continued to believe in OneCoin, despite all the evidence? Investors often told us that what drew them in initially was the fear that they would miss out on the next big thing. They'd read, with envy, the stories of people striking gold with Bitcoin and thought OneCoin was a second chance. Many were struck by the personality and persuasiveness of the visionary Dr Ruja. Investors might not have understood the technology, but they could see her talking to huge audiences, or at the Economist conference. They were shown photographs of her numerous degrees, and copies of Forbes magazine with her portrait on the front cover. The degrees are genuine. The Forbes cover isn't: it was actually an inside cover - a paid-for advertisement - from Forbes Bulgaria, but once the real cover was ripped off, it looked impressive. But it seems it's not just the promise of riches that keeps people believing. After Jen McAdam invested into OneCoin she was constantly told she was part of the OneCoin family. She was entered into a Whatsapp group, with its own leader who disseminated information from the headquarters in Sofia. And McAdam's leader prepared her carefully for conversations with OneCoin sceptics. You're told not to believe anything from the 'outside world', she recalls. That's what they call it. 'Haters' - Bitcoiners are 'haters'. Even Google - 'Don't listen to Google!' Any criticism or awkward questions were actively discouraged. If you have any negativity you should not be in this group, she was told. Prof Eileen Barker of the London School of Economics, who has spent years studying groups like the Moonies and Scientologists, says there are similarities between OneCoin and messianic millennium cults, where people believe they are part of something big that is going to change the world - and no matter what the evidence, once they've signed up, it's very hard for them to admit they are wrong. When prophecy fails they believe more strongly, she says. Particularly if you have invested something, not only money, but belief, reputation, intelligence. You think, 'Wait a bit longer.' Money might push people to invest in the first place, but the sense of belonging, of doing something, of achieving something, is why they stay, Barker says. And in that sense it's cultic. In an ideal world, regulators would take action to protect consumers from scams like OneCoin. But the authorities all over the world have been slow to react, partly because the whole area of cryptocurrencies is relatively new. The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which is responsible for regulating financial markets in the UK, issued a warning on its website only in September 2016. We believe consumers should be wary of dealing with OneCoin, it said. We are concerned about the potential risk this poses to UK consumers. Less than a year later, the warning was removed from the website. The FCA said it had been up for long enough, but OneCoin promoters presented this as proof that the UK authorities considered OneCoin a legitimate investment. There's the answer, right from the horse's mouth, it's official, said one promoter from Alberta, Canada, in a video posted online. If they still thought we were a fraudulent company, then guess what, that warning's not removed. Game over. Several OneCoin events took place in the UK after the FCA took down the warning, and money continued to be invested. The FCA did not respond to the BBC's request to comment. The fact that OneCoin was operating internationally also created difficulties for the authorities. In August this year, the City of London police ended a two-year investigation into OneCoin. The companies and individuals behind OneCoin are based outside UK jurisdiction, it said. We've been unable to identify UK-based assets, which could be used to compensate UK investors. Such explanations don't offer much comfort to those affected. I'm devastated for all the UK victims, Jen McAdam told me, when she heard the news. She now runs Whatsapp support groups for OneCoin investors who realise they have been swindled. Where's the support? Where's the help? More folk are going to promote this. It's a green light for the OneCoin scammers to continue and extort more money from innocent people in the UK and nothing has been done about it. They don't care! The City of London Police told the BBC: There was insufficient evidence to support criminal proceedings against individuals based in the UK, though the force has never specified that there had been no concerns surrounding OneCoin. The force has provided assistance to foreign law enforcement partners in respect of their investigations concerning OneCoin personnel and will continue to do this. If you believe you have been a victim of fraud in relation to OneCoin or you suspect someone of actively marketing OneCoin, please come forward and report it to Action Fraud online. Until this week, however, the OneCoin head office remained open for business - and people were continuing to promote the currency. Today doors are locked. No lights visible through the windows. pic.twitter.com/Qv2nNE8Mwf End of Twitter post by @Svrakata In the Ntangamo region of Uganda, not far from Rwandan border, most people make their living growing bananas, or sometimes cassava, sweet potato, beans or groundnut. In 2016 it was here that 22-year-old Daniel Lienhardt came as he was scraping together the 700,000 Ugandan shillings ($250) he needed to buy a OneCoin starter package. He already had 400,000 shillings in savings, and to raise the rest he returned from the capital, Kampala, to his family home, took three goats raised by his younger brothers, and sold them. There was no other way, he says ruefully. Daniel is one of thousands of Ugandans who've bought into Dr Ruja's fake cryptocurrency - and the OneCoin financial documents leaked to the BBC reveal that as time went on, investors like him became increasingly important to OneCoin. In Europe, less money was invested in the first six months of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. But in Africa, the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent, it was the other way round. As the money started drying up in Europe, promoters turned more and more to countries like Uganda. Daniel took me and Georgia to meet Prudence, who first introduced him to OneCoin. They are still friends, even though both now realise it's a scam. Prudence is a nurse in a Kampala slum, who thought she could make more money selling OneCoin and set about recruiting new investors. A senior promoter gave her a nice car to impress customers, and instructed her to visit farmers when their crops were being harvested and they had money in their pocket. People in villages trust people from the city, Prudence tells us. To buy the packages some sold their cattle, their land and even their houses - with disastrous consequences. Some of their kids are at home sitting without going to school - some don't have anywhere to sleep. Some are running because they got loans from a bank. Some are hiding. Some are divorced. If anyone asks Prudence when the investment is going to deliver the promised riches, she tells them to wait. She can't bring herself to tell them the truth. I'm somehow hiding myself. I don't want those people I introduced into OneCoin to see me moving around. They can easily kill me. They thought I ate their money. But though she has stopped recruiting, many others haven't, and there are still plenty of interested buyers, she says. One of the main OneCoin offices in Kampala is attached to a church. There are videos of the minister, known as Bishop Fred, leading the congregation in call and response. One Life! he shouts. One Coin! the congregations replies. Bishop Fred, we learned, is now one of the country's top promoters of OneCoin, though he says it's no longer promoted during church services. As in other countries, OneCoin has spread here through networks of friends and families. Together with Daniel, Georgia and I travel south to meet his mother. She lives in a concrete house with a tin roof - five small rooms, a small television and a cooking area. A towel covers the front door, and a few metres away is her land, where she grows her own food and sells anything left over at the local market. The family had saved about £3,000 to buy a maize store so that Daniel's mother could stop spending every day in the fields. But when Daniel found out about OneCoin, it suddenly seemed like a much better alternative. His mother had doubts, but he persuaded her to put the money into OneCoin instead. She had no computer or smartphone, to do her own research. She doesn't speak English either, so I'm shocked to discover, as we sit and talk, that Daniel has never actually told his mother that the money is lost. I've never told her directly that it's not going to work - that there is no more money, there's no more hope, he tells me. I've been telling her it's changing. They keep postponing this. That I don't know what they're thinking. Maybe it's just a delay. I haven't given her 100% full confirmation that it won't work. I ask him why not. It's hard. It's hard to say. Daniel's mother then tells us that when she first saw me and Georgia, she assumed it was a good sign - that perhaps it meant that her money was going to arrive at last. She asks what news we have about OneCoin. Will she get her money back? I look at Daniel. Maybe you can tell her… Maybe… he says. He doesn't seem certain it's a good idea. Perhaps it would put him in an uncomfortable position. I don't want to be the person that breaks the news to Daniel's mother. Georgia suggests we tell Daniel's mother that we are journalists, and that we are investigating OneCoin because a lot of people aren't getting their money. Daniel translates, and his mother's reply comes back. If you have your money and it's taken away from you, life becomes stressful, she says. You've been planning, planning for something. If it doesn't happen, life is hard. When we started planning the Missing Cryptoqueen podcast in late 2018, no-one really had a clue what happened to Dr Ruja after her disappearance. It was only earlier this year that the US authorities revealed she'd flown to Athens on 25 October 2017. And even then, the question remained, where had she gone next? There were rumours of course - lots of them. Igor Alberts, the MLM kingpin, said he'd heard she has Russian and Ukrainian passports and travels back and forth between Russia and Dubai. It's also been suggested that there are powerful people who might protect her in her native Bulgaria - and that she could hide in plain sight because of plastic surgery that makes her unrecognisable. I've even heard that she might be in London. Others told us she was dead - which does remain a possibility. This is clearly a question for a professional, which is why Georgia and I went to see private investigator Alan McLean. Finding people is his speciality, and there is one thing above all he says we should focus on. What was her lifestyle? That's the most important thing of all, he says. Go back to her life before OneCoin. Find out who her friends were, what her lifestyle was like, her family. Another tip he gives us is to find out where she has been on her yacht. We should try to get the tracker off it, he says, and he doesn't appear to be joking. I explain that this is probably beyond my abilities (apart from being illegal). Then he says I should check what yachts were bought in Athens around the time she arrived there from Sofia. In my opinion, for what it's worth, she's moving around the Mediterranean, he says. A few weeks after our meeting Alan gets back in touch, with some amazing information. His colleagues - also private investigators - visited top-end restaurants in Athens armed with photos of Ruja, and in one of them several waiters claimed to clearly remember her dining there earlier this year. When Georgia and I called them ourselves to check, they confirmed it. So it seems Ruja is still alive, and is able to visit a European capital without fearing arrest. Another lead comes our way when we pay a visit to a bizarre OneCoin beauty pageant in Bucharest. It's as glitzy as you would expect. Men are drinking champagne from the bottle, everyone is eyeing us in a way that makes us feel very uncomfortable. We soak up the atmosphere, cheer the British contestant, and then leave. But later we hear that we might have been in the presence of Dr Ruja - that she was there, in the same room, right in front of our noses. Except now with plastic surgery, and so harder to spot. From either Greece or Romania Dr Ruja could be extradited to the US. If it's true she was in these countries earlier this year, she probably has a fake identity. Taking seriously Alan McLean's advice about studying Dr Ruja's life before OneCoin, Georgia and I turn to the internet, which fortunately never forgets anything. Even the most obscure entry or innocuous comment on a forum is usually saved somewhere, and with enough digging can be found. You've heard of Google, but there are several other search engines that specialise in this. So we start unearthing previous addresses, known friends, old phone numbers, anything that could help us. We already knew that Dr Ruja spent some of her childhood in Schramberg, southern Germany. We had also visited the town of Waltenhofen in Bavaria, not far away, where she and her father bought a steelworks around a decade ago, an episode that led to her being tried for fraud. (She received a fine and a suspended sentence in October 2016.) While in Waltenhofen, we learned that she had a German husband, a lawyer for the well-known firm, Linklaters. But we were still surprised when, during our internet searches, Frankfurt started appearing over and over again. It wasn't a place we'd previously thought of looking. There were several old addresses in the Frankfurt area - ones she'd posted in forums many years ago, or were associated somehow with old phone numbers of hers. Then we started looking at some old photos of Ruja, and spotted one friend who appeared with her all the way back to 2011. And that friend was visiting the richest neighbourhood in Frankfurt in summer this year. From a tiny fragment of a poster advertising a tennis tournament, an expert identified the park in which one photograph was taken. We also learned that Dr Ruja had a daughter in late 2016, and that she remained very close to her. The daughter, we were informed, might be in Frankfurt. This is also where Dr Ruja's husband - or perhaps ex-husband - lives and works. Armed with a microphone and several photographs of Dr Ruja, we headed off to Frankfurt and searched old addresses and gated neighbourhoods said to be the most expensive in Germany. A couple of people looked at the photographs and paused for a long time, raising our hopes - but then said they didn't recognise her. A postman thought he recognised the name, but couldn't be sure. We called the lawyer who is (or was) married to her, and he didn't want to talk. Did we get close to her? Could she really be hiding out in the heart of the EU? We don't know. Frankfurt probably isn't the only place she goes - it might be one of several places, including perhaps Dubai and Russia. Then a few days later we received a call from a trusted source we cannot identify. He told us we were right - Frankfurt is indeed where she spends much of her time. But we need to keep going, we needed to find the house. You will find her, he said. You must dig deeper. She would have known that we were looking for her, he added, and she would have laughed at us. On 5 November 2019, the day after the final episode of The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast was released, Dr Ruja's brother, Konstantin Ignatov, appeared in court in New York, testifying for the government in a case against a lawyer accused of laundering $400m of the money OneCoin made in the US. In court it was revealed that Ignatov signed a plea deal on 4 October, in which he pleaded guilty to several fraud charges. A court reporter was there to hear his testimony, and according to his account of the proceedings Ignatov appears to have implied that his sister had duped him with the same line the organisation put out to its investors - that OneCoin critics were haters who could not be believed. She vanished, he said, because she was afraid that somebody close to her was going to give her up to the FBI. She had got hold of a big passport, he said, and asked him to get her plane tickets to Vienna, then Athens. OneCoin has always denied wrongdoing. It told the BBC: OneCoin verifiably fulfils all criteria of the definition of a crypto-currency. It said the Missing Cryptoqueen podcast will not present any truthful information and cannot be considered objective, nor unbiased. It added that the allegations made about it around the world were being challenged, stating: Our partners, our customers and our lawyers are fighting successfully against this action around the globe and we are sure that the vision of a new system on the basis of a 'financial revolution' will be established. Some action at the OneCoin HQ at last. Doors opened. A small beaten down van parked in front and was filled with various office equipment and supplies. Didn't seem to be the contents of the famous 3rd floor cash room :) Looked as if the company is moving out, but who knows... pic.twitter.com/vH0XzMFef0 End of Twitter post 2 by @Svrakata OneCoin was a familiar scam with a digital twist - a new and hugely successful take on the old pyramid scheme. But to me it symbolises something else too. It represents the dark side of rapid technological change - the way that every new technology creates amazing new opportunities and possibilities for people who understand it, but also the chance to exploit the people who don't. Dr Ruja identified several of society's weak spots and exploited them. She knew there would be enough people either desperate enough, or greedy enough, or confused enough to take a bet on OneCoin. She understood that truth and lies are getting harder to tell apart when there is so much contradictory information online. She spotted that society's defence against OneCoin - the law-makers, the police, and also us in the media would struggle to understand what was happening. And, most frustratingly of all, she correctly guessed that by the time we realised it, she'd be gone, along with the money."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-52196670,Coronavirus hacks: How to build better relationships remotely,"With measures to tackle coronavirus leaving so many people unable to meet family and friends, how can we make more meaningful connections when we're on phone calls or using video apps? Experts offer their hacks. At a time when we miss seeing friends, we can be seduced into having lots of video calls. But research suggests we might be better at detecting someone else's emotions without visual clues. Our hacks: With expertise from psychology professor Christian van Nieuwerburgh, of the University of East London, and US-based neuroscientist David Eagleman. Research shows that when we increase eye contact, others pay more attention to us, says Prof Jeremy Bailenson, founding director of Stanford University's Virtual Human Interaction Lab. But video calls present a challenge because on many devices the camera is positioned at the edge of the screen. We have to choose between looking someone in the eye and reading nonverbal signals, like a curious face, says Prof Bailenson. For 30 years, videoconferencing companies have tried all sorts of devices to try and solve the eye-contact problem but no-one has nailed it. He also points to the latency problem - the time lag between an action and seeing it on screen, between your voice and your movements. Typically a 10th to a quarter of a second, it also affects our ability to connect. Bridget Waller, professor of evolutionary psychology at the University of Portsmouth, says reading expressions becomes especially challenging when we are on a group video chat, as we miss out on gaze cues. Of all primates, humans have the largest proportion of whites in our eyes, called sclera, associated with being able to detect who others are looking at, she says. This skill is crucial to our species but can't be used on a group video call with everyone looking at their screens. Our hacks: With expertise from Prof Jeremy Bailenson. Carey Jewitt, professor of technology and communication at University College London, believes the lack of touch in online conversations presents the biggest challenge. Touch is our first sense, we feel it in the womb and it's key to giving and receiving information and to help us bond, she says. Research suggests emotion and touch are strongly related. Though the UK as a whole is one of the most touch-averse societies, people still touch when they greet. In a pub, for example, there is a warmth and comfort of being near people. Though we may not touch, we are so close that we feel touched. Prof Jewitt's team is researching ways for people to virtually touch, by sending heat vibrations and pressure to another person through a wearable device. In trials of jackets that inflate and give you a sense of being held when your partner sends a message, one participant said: Even though it is a machine squeezing me, I think of you as hugging me.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52199185,Coronavirus: What's happening to the beer left in pubs?,"Pubs, like other public venues, look set to stay shut for the foreseeable future. But what's going to happen to the contents of their cellars? Fifty million pints - give or take. That's the amount of beer expected to go unused in barrels if pubs remain closed into the summer because of coronavirus. Publicans are currently unable to sell their lagers, ales and ciders - save for takeaways and home deliveries. It's a very sad waste of all the work and talent that goes into producing great beer, says Tom Stainer, chief executive of the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra). People won't get to drink it and all those resources have been used up for nothing. Mr Stainer estimates the UK's 39,000 pubs have, on average, 15 barrels in their cellar at any given time. Most are kegs containing 11 gallons (88 pints) each - although many real ales come in nine-gallon (72-pint) casks. The best-before dates on pasteurised beer - including most lagers - are usually three to four months after delivery. Those for real ales and other unpasteurised beer are usually set at six to nine weeks. So most stock could go to waste if social distancing measures remain in place for several months. Keris De Villiers, landlady of the Ram Inn, the Old Sergeant and the Pig and Whistle in Wandsworth, south-west London, says barrelled beer worth about £10,000 could go off in her cellars - while 1,000 litres (1,760 pints) more beer remains in vats at the SlyBeast microbrewery she and husband Lee have recently set up. We could do takeaways, she says, but that would mean selling beer on the corner of a very small pavement. That wouldn't be socially responsible, with the need for people to keep their distance from one another. The whole situation is heart-breaking. Our brewer literally talks to his tanks when he's at work every day. People really care about the beer they're making. It's a craft and people are passionate about it. Supermarket alcohol sales increased by more than a fifth last month as pubs - along with cafes and restaurants - closed on 20 March. People are missing these things in their lives, says Mr Stainer. It's not the biggest issue that the country is dealing with, but aspects of life like going to the cinema or cafe, or going for a pint, are something we treasure. Many breweries and distributors have offered to take back barrels at no charge once the lockdown is over, taking some of the financial pressure off landlords. Iain Crockett, director of Gloucestershire-based Severn Brewing, says draymen - people who deliver beer - face the worst week of their lives when the pub trade returns, having to lift full barrels - rather than empties - out of cellars. He wants there to be at least a couple of weeks' notice before pubs are allowed to reopen. All the little brewers are going to be completely shafted otherwise, Mr Crockett says. While the big brewers have large storage capacities, small operators will be starting more from scratch, he adds. Before that, though, there's the question of how to get rid of tens of millions of pints. Can we expect scenes like those following the introduction of Prohibition in the US a century ago, where bottles and barrels were smashed, their contents poured away? Probably not. In the US, bar owners have been told not to tip out-of-date beer down storm drains, because it's illegal and environmentally damaging. Some UK publicans, have, however, already resorted to this. The British Institute of Innkeeping is advising against such action, amid concern it could leave landlords further out of pocket. Under Treasury rules, when publicans get rid of large amounts of spoilt beer, duty doesn't need to be paid on it. Brewery representatives normally oversee this process, but because of social distancing they can't visit premises at the moment. The government has temporarily allowed brewers to appoint publicans to oversee the dumping of beer. But they must keep a proper record of it, including perhaps filming a video as proof it's been destroyed, rather than put aside for profit. One option that publicans and brewers who spoke to the BBC would love to try is converting out-of-date beer into hand sanitiser, by extracting the alcohol. Independent brewer Brewdog is already making hand sanitiser at its Aberdeenshire premises, while the government is giving manufacturers who want to do the same priority access to the methylated spirits - or denatured alcohol - they need. Despite these difficult times, Mrs De Villiers says pub owners and tenants are doing all we can to survive and assist the community. The breweries are helping us and they want us to survive, she adds. Everyone's ready to help everyone else. In an effort to limit the economic damage caused by coronavirus, the government has offered £330bn in loans, £20bn in other aid, a business rates holiday, and grants for retailers and pubs. Pubs are at the heart of our communities and an important part of local economies, says a spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. We've asked them to temporarily close in order to help protect people and reduce the spread of the virus. But we are also delivering support to help businesses, including pubs, through the coronavirus pandemic."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52236388,Coronavirus: What Boris Johnson's Greek hero teaches us about epidemics,"As Boris Johnson recovers from Covid-19, he will undoubtedly be thinking of an earlier epidemic, says Oxford classicist Armand D'Angour - the plague that hit Athens in 430 BC, and killed the prime minister's hero, Pericles. It's an episode, D'Angour argues, that holds many lessons for today. Britain's Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, is well versed in the history and culture of ancient Greece. He knows that Western literature begins with a plague, the epidemic described in the opening book of Homer's Iliad - of which Boris can happily declaim scores of verses from memory. And his political hero has long been the ancient Athenian leader, Pericles, whose bust sits in his office in 10 Downing Street. The prime minister has often quoted admiringly the stirring oration given by Pericles to honour the dead after the first year of a destructive war against Sparta. And he will be well aware that Pericles gave a second famous speech a year later, after a devastating plague, probably a form of typhus, had killed around one third of Athens' citizens. Both orations were reported by the contemporary historian Thucydides, whose searing description of the Great Plague is worth reading for its literary virtuosity alone. Commentators today have drawn parallels between the responses of Athenians - ranging from the heroic to the contemptible - and those of valiant NHS staff and scared panic-buyers today. But surprisingly, none has drawn attention to the lesson Thucydides himself intended. What doesn't change, wrote the historian, is human nature; you can expect people to react in similar ways when they encounter events like those that have occurred in the past. He embarked on his work, he says, because a clear grasp of the events he was living through could guide responses to similar events in future. He modelled his method on that of the most innovative medical practitioner of the day, the physician Hippocrates. Rather than prescribing prayers and religious rituals, spells and incantations, or exotic herbs and quack remedies, Hippocrates and his contemporaries were visiting sick patients, meticulously noting their symptoms, and keeping track of how they responded to prescribed treatments such as sleep, exercise, and the regulation of diet. Boris Johnson was a patient at St Thomas' hospital, and is likely to have been participating in a medical trial that compares treatments for Covid-19 - so it may be that Hippocrates will come to his mind, as well as Pericles and Thucydides. One of the worst aspects of the plague was the despair into which people fell on finding they had the disease. Those who were convinced they had no hope were much quicker to give up and die, observed Thucydides. Another was the rate of infection among those who flocked to care for and doctor to others: they died in droves, and had the highest incidence of mortality… In addition, the plague led to greater crime, since criminals calculated on escaping detection and penalties. What might we learn from these observations? First, that people should avoid becoming infected by close contact, and that medical staff and carers should be protected. Secondly, that the law must continue to function robustly. And thirdly, that it is important for people to preserve a positive state of mind. Measures to achieve these aims have been, if in some cases belatedly, widely pursued in the UK and elsewhere. The Athenians survived the plague of 430 BC with astonishing resilience. Just 15 years later they were able to muster a huge military and naval force to mount an offensive expedition overseas. But when the plague struck, Athens had only recently gone to war, and a large contingent of troops had been sent north to pursue hostilities. Sadly, they took the disease with them, and over 1,000 men died from it. One of the soldiers serving on the campaign was the philosopher, Socrates. Not only did he survive infection, allegedly thanks to his physical toughness and discipline, but on return to his plague-ridden city he was said to have tended unscathed to the sick and dying. Socrates had evidently acquired immunity from his earlier exposure to the disease, just as Thucydides himself, who had survived infection, recognised that this made him immune from reinfection. It was to be thousands of years before medical immunity was properly understood, but the historian implies that historical hindsight can itself be a kind of vaccine. History need not simply recall the horrors of the past. It can guide us towards adopting precautions, remind us that accurate observation is vital to ensure a better response in future, and reassure us that normal life will one day return. Meanwhile, we should also remember that history never repeats itself exactly, even if it can offer valuable lessons for posterity. Pericles had been the leading citizen in Athens for over three decades before his death from the plague at the age of 66. Until that day his luck had held to a remarkable degree. He had been admired and bitterly reviled, had fought military campaigns and faced legal trials, and had survived accusations of corruption and sexual misconduct. In his 50s he entered into a passionate and enduring relationship with the brilliant young Aspasia of Miletus, who bore him a child and helped him compose his magnificent funeral oration to the war dead. Britain's prime minister is 55. He has faced stern challenges, has experienced failure as well and success, and has benefited greatly from luck, no less than political skill. When, as is hoped, he makes a full recovery from Covid-19, perhaps busts of the historian Thucydides, the physician Hippocrates, and the philosopher Socrates, should join that of Pericles on his mantelpiece in No.10 Downing Street. Prof Armand D'Angour, the author of Socrates in Love: The making of a philosopher, wrote the Greek ode that Boris Johnson recited at the opening gala of the London Olympics in 2012 In these dark days of Covid-19 some practices have remained timeless - the use of soap, scrubbing and fresh air. Other advice on infectious diseases given my grandfather Dr John Davy Rolleston in 1940 sounds, well, from a bygone era. Does my grandfather's 1940 infectious disease advice still hold true?"
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52268341,Coronavirus: New Zealand nurse who treated Boris Johnson says it was 'surreal',"A New Zealand nurse praised by Boris Johnson for helping to save his life said treating the prime minister was the most surreal time in her life, her parents have said. Jenny McGee, along with Luis Pitarma from Portugal, was praised by the PM for standing at his bedside when things could have gone either way. Ms McGee's parents told Television New Zealand they are exceptionally proud. They said she treated Mr Johnson like any other patient. Mr Johnson was discharged from St Thomas' Hospital in London on Sunday, one week after being admitted to be treated for coronavirus. He spent several nights in the intensive care unit where he was given oxygen. He said the NHS has saved my life, no question and paid tribute to many medics, singling out Ms McGee and Mr Pitarma specifically. Ms McGee's parents said they knew Mr Johnson was in the hospital their daughter works in as it was all over the news. But our daughter's very professional so we don't ask things or she doesn't spill things. It really wasn't until he was out of intensive care until she actually told us, her mother Caroline told TVNZ. She said she had just had a most surreal time in her life, something she will never forget. And that she had been taking care of Boris. She added: It makes us feel exceptionally proud, obviously. But she has told us these things over the years and it doesn't matter what patient she's looking after, this is what she does and I just find it incredible that she, any nurses, can do this for 12 hours. Sit and watch a patient, and twiddle away with all the different knobs to keep their patients alive. It's absolutely amazing. Her brother Rob said that when he spoke to her she was on her way to work to do another night shift. He told the New Zealand Herald: We are all very proud of Jen, not just in the support she gave Boris - but what she has been doing helping everyday people. Whilst she is blown away by Boris's recognition, she is just really pleased to see the public recognition for the amazing work the NHS is doing - that made her really proud. Ms McGee is from Invercargill, on New Zealand's South Island. The mayor of the city Sir Tim Shadbolt told Stuff.co.nz: It's not very often a nurse from Invercargill saves the life of the British prime minister. Meanwhile, her former school Verdon College paid tribute to her courage, adding she had wanted to be a nurse since leaving school in 2002. Jenny is described by her past teachers as an absolutely delightful person and someone who had a caring and humble nature, the college said in a statement. The second nurse mentioned by Mr Johnson has been named as Luis Pitarma. According to the Expresso, Mr Pitarma, 29, is from Aveiro in Portugal and moved to London six years ago. He studied nursing in Lisbon. It added that he first worked at the Luton and Dunstable University Hospital for two years before moving to St Thomas'. The president of Portugal, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, has personally thanked Mr Pitarma, as well as the commitment of all Portuguese health professionals who in Portugal and around the world are providing decisive help in the fight to the pandemic. On Monday, No 10 confirmed Mr Johnson had left hospital after being given the all clear by medics. He will continue recovering at Chequers, the prime minister's official country residence, as it was considered to be a suitable place and he will not be carrying out government work, the spokesman said. Aides are reportedly expecting Mr Johnson to be out of action for up to a month while he recovers. Mr Johnson spoke to Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab - who is currently in charge of running the government - over the weekend, No 10 added. Speaking in a video posted after he left hospital, Mr Johnson, 55, said it was hard to find words to express my debt to the health service. He thanked many nurses by name before adding: I hope they won't mind if I mention in particular two nurses who stood by my bedside for 48 hours when things could have gone either way. They're Jenny from New Zealand. And Luis from Portugal near Porto. The reason in the end my body did start to get enough oxygen was because for every second of the night they were watching and they were thinking and they were caring and making the interventions I needed. Around one in eight NHS workers - 13.1% of the workforce, or 153,000 staff - are not British, according to a parliamentary report published in July last year. After British, the most common nationalities of NHS staff are Indian with around 21,000 workers, followed by Filipino, Irish, Polish and then Portuguese staff. On Sunday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock paid tribute to everyone who has joined the NHS from all over the world."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52264743,Apollo 13: Enhanced images reveal life on stricken spacecraft,"Image enhancement techniques have been used to reveal life aboard Nasa's stricken Apollo 13 spacecraft in unprecedented detail. Fifty years ago, the craft suffered an explosion that jeopardised the lives of the three astronauts aboard. Unsurprisingly, given they were locked in a fight for survival, relatively few onboard images were taken. But imaging specialist Andy Saunders created sharp stills from low-quality 16mm film shot by the crew. One of the techniques used by Mr Saunders is known as stacking, in which many frames are assembled on top of each other to improve the image's detail. Crewed by Nasa astronauts Jim Lovell, Jack Swigert and Fred Haise, Apollo 13 was supposed to be the third American mission to land on the lunar surface. During the journey to the Moon, an explosion in the service module allowed some of the spacecraft's oxygen to leak out into space. Astronaut Jack Swigert reported the accident to ground controllers with the immortal, and much misquoted, phrase: Okay, Houston, we've had a problem here. The part of the Apollo spacecraft designed to return the astronauts through Earth's atmosphere after the mission - the command module (CM) - had to be shut down to conserve its remaining resources for re-entry. The crew had to use the lunar module (LM) - also known as the lander - as a lifeboat. The lander's life support systems were designed for two astronauts living for two days on the lunar surface. Experts at Nasa's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, had to figure out a way to stretch its resources so that it could support three crew members for four days. Lovell, Swigert and Haise looped around the Moon and back to Earth in a cold, damp module with limited drinking water. Luckily, the improvised plan to get them back was a success, and the three astronauts splashed down safely into the Pacific Ocean. Despite their grave predicament, the crew used a 16mm film camera to record scenes of life aboard the spacecraft. But the footage is of low quality by today's standards. It is this footage that Mr Saunders used as the basis of his enhanced images, which reveal new insights into the crew's fight for survival aboard the damaged spacecraft. A composite panorama of the lunar module lifeboat shows Commander Jim Lovell's attempts at normality by selecting some music on a tape player, while command module pilot Jack Swigert takes a nap in the storage area. Another, dubbed Happy crew by Mr Saunders, captures Lovell and Swigert in apparent high spirits. One striking thing about the 16mm footage is how calm the crew appear, given the grave nature of the situation, the conditions, and the critical mission tasks that lay ahead, Mr Saunders told BBC News. This perhaps belies their true feelings as we know that, in reality, the crew doubted if they would make it home alive. The crew members are eating in the scene. The freeze-dried food relied on mixing it with hot water, but only cold water was available. Lovell later admitted he had eaten little in the days following the accident, losing 6kg (14lb) in weight. A panorama of the dark, powered-down command module was produced from footage shot by Fred Haise when he went to check it out before the rest of the crew moved back in for the risky return through the Earth's atmosphere. In an interview for a new Nasa documentary called Apollo 13: Home Safe, Haise recalls how damp it was in the CM. The astronauts had to wipe down the panels with towels because of a concern that the water could cause an electrical short that could lead to a fire. This would have been catastrophic in the spacecraft's enclosed environment. Two concepts are important for understanding the technique used to process the images: signal - the parts of the image that are desirable to keep - and noise - the unwanted parts of the image. Mr Saunders started by stacking different frames of the same scene on top of one another. It all hinges on the principle that stacking images improves the signal-to-noise ratio, Mr Saunders explained. He added: As the noise in each frame is truly random, then stacking multiple frames of the same scene on top of each other and averaging out the levels of each aligned pixel has the effect of identifying and reducing noise whilst maintaining signal (the signal will be present on all frames). This ultimately boosts the detail, along with overall image quality, making it more photo-like. But because he was dealing with moving pictures, Mr Saunders had to re-align multiple parts of the image, combining all the results into one final picture. These combined images are made up of more than 20 sections stitched together, with each section consisting of a stack of up to 75 separate processed frames, revealing the crew and spacecraft in unprecedented detail. Using commercial software, he then enhanced the photos; adjusting the contrast, correcting the colour and removing some of the fish-eye effect resulting from the wide angle lens that was needed to capture events in such a confined space. More restored images from the Apollo missions, including those from the Apollo 13, can be viewed on Andy Saunders' Twitter feed. Follow Paul on Twitter."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-52222547,Final Fantasy 7 Remake: 'This is not just for the players of the original',"Cloud Strife and his iconic mop of spiked blonde hair emerge through the rising steam of an overcrowded city. The main character of Final Fantasy 7 has his distinctive buster sword strapped to his back. This time, however, he's not a pixelated image as seen in the 1997 PlayStation original - he's been fully rendered in life-like modern graphics. It's been five years since gamers got a first glimpse of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake, when the first trailer dropped. The remake, which is out now, is a completely rebuilt version of a role-playing game that has sold more than 12 million copies worldwide. And fans of the original are excited to make a return to Midgar, the fantasy city where the remake takes place. One of those eagerly awaiting the release is Youtuber Elz the Witch, who says she felt really emotional when she first played the remake. When the title screen came up with the theme music, it looked exactly how I imagined it looking 23 years ago, but with a hundred times better graphics, she tells BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat. I didn't expect to be emotional but it's just that nostalgia of something that you've wanted for so long - and you've grown up with - to see come to fruition is really remarkable. For civil servant Rob Bowman, it helped him understand his sexuality. Cloud is the protagonist and I related to him a lot, he says. In the game, he's trying to figure out who he is, and I was doing the same when I was playing it, although for different reasons. For me, it was figuring out my sexuality. Within the game Cloud found out who he was, and it made him stronger as a result. To this day, I feel it was the same for me. The game helped me open my eyes. Getting the remake right for fans of the original, like Rob and Elz, was important for the development team. Yoshinori Kitase, one of the game's producers, told Newsbeat: You'll really get that that hit of nostalgia as soon as you start playing. There are loads of little moments to recognize and go, 'wow, I really remember this', but it's cool and exciting to see how it's been depicted in in a more modern style. It's been 23 years since the release of the original. That game broke new ground in terms of its visual style and storytelling - and fans have idolised the story and characters. But in the two decades since it was first released, a brand-new generation of gamers has emerged. And that's something the development team were very aware of. This is not just for the players of the original, the remake's director, Naoki Hamaguchi, tells Newsbeat. It's got the same really well-loved core elements to it, but shown with more style, which will really help the game resonate with players today. To do that the team have added story details that were not explored in the original and designed an entirely new way for battles to take place. Yoshinori and Naoki agree it was important to get the balance right between innovating and staying true to the original. Early reviews are positive but it's too early to tell how the game has landed with new players - although Elz is pleased with what she's played. There are always going to be high expectations that the remake is going to be held against, she says. I can only speak for myself and I'm really enjoying with how the gameplay has developed. Rob is still waiting to get his hands on the release after a mix-up with his pre-order. He's struggled with his health in recent years but believes the wait will be worth it. About three years ago I had to have emergency surgery on my heart, it was very likely that I would have died, he says. But I came around and the first thing I thought about, the thing I was most upset about, was the fact that I nearly didn't get to play Final Fantasy 7 Remake. Expectations are high and the development team know that. We would definitely be lying if we said there's no pressure at all, they tells Newsbeat. We think perhaps more important than that is the passion and the desire of the team to make something good. Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-52196817,Coronavirus: What's the latest with Brexit and other big stories?,"Over the past few months, the coronavirus pandemic has absorbed all the energy of the news cycle. There hasn't been an event like it in our lifetimes. But this isn't to say that it's the only important thing happening in the world right now. So what's going on elsewhere - and what happened to some of the other big news stories of the year? Remember Brexit? For about three years you hardly heard about anything else in the UK. Now, of course, the focus is on the coronavirus pandemic. Despite Prime Minister Boris Johnson requiring hospital treatment after contracting Covid-19 and the European Union and UK chief negotiators only recently coming out of coronavirus quarantine, Downing Street insists it will stick to its original timetable. The UK formally left the European Union on 31 January. But we are now in a transition period up to 31 December, during which the UK is still treated pretty much as an EU member while negotiations continue. Britain's government says an EU-UK trade deal must be in place by the last day of the year. But even if not, the UK won't prolong the transition period beyond that deadline. The idea behind the transition period was to minimise disruption caused to business and travel between the UK and the EU. It can be extended by a year or two - which the EU thinks would be a sensible move under the circumstances. There has only been one round of EU-UK trade negotiations so far. They restart this week via video conference and both sides say they'll do their best to make good and speedy progress. But time is slipping away. Brussels also asks whether UK and EU businesses - already struggling with the upheaval caused by the coronavirus - need another big change come the end of this year. But whatever they think, EU leaders won't formally ask the UK for an extension. The tight timetable was decided by Boris Johnson, they say. A decision to delay - if there is one - must come from London. A ceasefire few expected to last is holding in Idlib, for now, as the last rebel-held area in northwest Syria braces for the expected onslaught of the deadly coronavirus. People are breathing for the time being, and that can be viewed as a side effect of the pandemic, says Hassan Hassan of the Center for Global Policy. The ceasefire is hanging by a thread, but it's hanging nonetheless. The 5 March truce agreed by Russia and Turkey halted a dangerous escalation after Ankara sent thousands of its troops across the border to try to halt a Syrian offensive to retake this last province lost in nine punishing years of war. But Idlib's breathing space is also fraught with fear of this new enemy. The province's health system has been decimated by fighting, including the blistering air campaign by Russian and Syrian warplanes. Nearly a million displaced people, sheltering inside flimsy tents, or on open ground, have few defences against the powerful Covid-19. There's a humanitarian and political imperative… for a complete, immediate nationwide ceasefire throughout Syria, said UN Special Envoy to Syria, Geir Pedersen, in his recent briefing to the UN Security Council. Turkey and Russia, who back opposing sides, now call the shots. I don't think Turkey or Russia believe this ceasefire will hold for a long time, says Dareen Khalifa, Senior Analyst with the International Crisis Group. It left key issues unresolved. That includes the future of the jihadist group Hayat Tahir al-Sham (HTS), which dominates Idlib. The HTS, sceptical of this truce, is said to be regrouping. The Syrian and Turkish armies are also taking advantage of this pause to reinforce in preparation for the next round of battle. It may be just a matter of time - but now, it seems, is not the time. For nearly a month, the race among Democrats to see who would take on US President Donald Trump in the general election was in deep freeze. Former Vice-President Joe Biden had a commanding lead in the primaries, but self-professed democratic socialist Bernie Sanders - once considered the front-runner - was unwilling to concede. Meanwhile, state after state postponed their primary votes because of the coronavirus pandemic. Both candidates cancelled all public events and only issued video statements and conducted interviews from their homes. That changed on Wednesday, as Sanders suspended his campaign, all but ensuring that in November American voters will choose between Trump and Biden. Exactly when - and how - the two candidates will be formally nominated by their parties is in some doubt, however. The Democrats have already moved their national convention from mid-July to August in the hope that a gathering of thousands of activists, officials and party faithful will then be possible, both from a health and logistical standpoint. But that new date, along with the Republican convention set for the end of August, still seems questionable. As for the race itself, Trump has seen a slight bump in his poll standings since the pandemic began, perhaps due to his ubiquitous television presence in daily afternoon White House press conferences. Biden still holds a slight advantage in head-to-head matchups, however, suggesting the race is destined to be close. But there's no telling what the national mood will be in a few weeks, let alone when the November voting day arrives. The conflict in Yemen, which entered its sixth year in March, has long been labelled the world's forgotten war. With the past few weeks seeing yet another spike in the fighting, and as the world's attention is firmly fixed elsewhere, Yemen's war has felt more forgotten than ever. Two weeks ago, attacks on cities in Saudi Arabia, claimed by Houthi rebels, led to a series of retaliatory airstrikes on Northern Yemen by the Saudi-led coalition. It isn't just the fighting that Yemen's civilians are having to endure. I remember reporting on the cholera epidemic in 2016, and memories of the country's inability to respond to the spread of the disease are still fresh in my mind. It was heart-breaking to watch as people who had contracted the disease found they had no hospital to turn to. That Yemen is now facing the threat of a new ruthless disease, one which requires hospital beds and ventilators the country doesn't have, is a terrifying prospect. The announcement of a ceasefire this week will be welcome news for most Yemenis, but the heavy toll of the past half-decade means that even if the war was to end today, it would take decades for the country to recover. Six years of bombings and destruction have resulted in what the UN has called the world's worst humanitarian crisis. The scale, severity and complexity of the country's needs are staggering. The war has deeply fractured Yemen's economy and reduced its public institutions, its infrastructure and its health system to rubble. Eighty per cent of the entire population require external aid just to survive. And yet, the UN announced this week that it was decreasing its operations in the country, citing lack of funding. As the spectre of Covid-19 looms larger, people across Yemen, fully aware that their country simply won't be able to cope against the impending threat, are bracing themselves. In early November, the New South Wales government announced a state of emergency and issued the first catastrophic fire warning since the rating was put in place 10 years ago. Record-breaking heat, strong winds and the relentless drought - which lasted for at least three years in some areas - fuelled the bushfires. The blazes left 11 million hectares scorched and more than 2,000 properties destroyed. Australia's wildlife was decimated. One billion animals were lost and pictures of burned koalas and kangaroos made global headlines. The controversy and anger towards the prime minister and the way he handled the crisis and his approach to climate change were as much a part of the story as the fires themselves. Eventually the rain came, flooding some areas while ending years of drought in others. There was enough rain to put out most of the fires until they were all under control. It was a huge reprieve for the volunteer firefighters who had not stopped working for months and were exhausted. On 31 March, the New South Wales Rural Fire Service announced the official end of the most destructive bushfire season the state and the country has experienced. Although the fires are out, the damage is still there. The bushfires had a catastrophic impact on the economy - especially in the tourism sector. Many communities have been trying to rebuild, but it's been a slow and difficult process, now made more difficult by the fact everything is on hold because of Covid-19. Many families are worried that with the government now turning their full attention to tackling the virus, their own losses and struggles will be forgotten."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52229828,Coronavirus: Six ways the lockdown has changed the UK,"Life in the UK has been utterly transformed in the three weeks since restrictions were brought in to curb the spread of coronavirus. On Monday 23 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said all non-essential travel and public gatherings had to stop, with people urged to leave home only for exercise, to shop for essential items, for medical care, or when their work could not be done at home. All shops selling non-essential items closed. Pubs, restaurants, theatres, cinemas and places of worship have all also shut. These restrictions have affected all aspects of society. The lockdown's aim has been to limit the spread of coronavirus across the country, to help the NHS to cope and ultimately reduce the number of deaths from the disease. Since the lockdown started on 23 March, the number of people who have tested positive for coronavirus has gone from 6,650 to more than 80,000. But the government's advisers have said there is evidence that the public's adherence to the measures is starting to have an impact. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, said: It's not taking off in that sharp uptake, it's not gone sky high. And if anything there might even be some flattening. That is because of what we're all doing with social distancing. People are also adapting to how they use the health service. In March, the number of people attending A&E dropped whilst the numbers of calls made to 111 - the NHS's hotline - reached record highs. The public's use of transport has fallen dramatically over the past few weeks, although this trend started before the lockdown measures were announced by the prime minister, as many people started to work from home. Overall transport use - across road, rail and the Tube in London - fell by 60% between early February and the beginning of April, the Department for Transport says. Footfall at major railway stations across the country has also fallen significantly since the lockdown was introduced, data from Network Rail suggests. For example, in the week before the measures were brought in, footfall at Birmingham New Street station stood at over half a million. But that had fallen by 86% at the start of April to just 71,230. It's a similar trend for London and Manchester. Meanwhile, trips to parks and beaches on 5 April, the second Sunday of lockdown, were 29% lower than normal according to Google analytics data. But the previous Sunday they were 52% lower than normal, suggesting trips were creeping back up with the warmer weather. Air pollution levels in the UK have dropped significantly in the weeks since the country went into lockdown. The nitrogen dioxide (NO2) level has fallen across the UK, with the daily average down almost 40% on the same period last year. NO2, released from car exhausts, is a serious air pollutant. Some cities have seen levels fall by more than 60%, including Brighton and Portsmouth, according to BBC analysis of Defra statistics. Daily readings from air quality monitoring stations were compared with the same period last year. About 723,000 people have applied for universal credit since the lockdown began. Of these, 473,000 applied in the first eight days, almost as many as applied during the whole of the preceding three weeks, and almost 10 times as many as would apply in an average week. A further 250,000 people signed up during the second week of lockdown according to the Department for Work and Pensions. Universal credit is a consolidated monthly payment for those of working-age, which replaced a host of previous benefits including income-based jobseeker's allowance, housing benefit, child tax credit and working tax credit. While furlough payments are available to help the self-employed and those who cannot do their jobs during the pandemic, some groups - such as those who have recently became a freelancer, moved jobs or been made redundant before the cut-off date are not eligible. This has helped prompt an increase in universal credit claims. While there is still considerable pressure on the benefits system, the figures show that the number of claims is now starting to come down, having peaked in the first week of lockdown. In the week before the restrictions started, supermarket sales were 44% higher than the same time last year, as many rushed to stock up amid fear of shortages. But average sales fell by 7.5% over the first fortnight of lockdown according to consultancy Neilsen. When the country was told not to travel people stopped shopping, says Mike Watkins, Nielsen's head of retailer and business insight. They had already bought a lot of stuff, and their larders and freezers were full. While more people tried to shop online, as 93% of purchases are normally made in-store, supermarkets have struggled to cope with the extra demand, he adds. Supermarket sales of non-food products such as clothes slumped 45%, and impulse buys have dipped. The enthusiasm of shoppers to buy nice food will be muted, as people want to limit travel and time spent in stores, Mr Watkins says. The National Domestic Abuse helpline has seen a 25% increase in calls since the lockdown, the charity Refuge says. It is now receiving hundreds of extra calls for help every week. Isolation can make pre-existing abusive behaviour worse, but isn't the reason for it, says Refuge, which runs the helpline. The increase echoes findings from around the world, including a 32% surge in reported domestic violence cases in France, and a 12% increase to Spain's gender violence hotline since lockdowns began in those countries. However, overall crime reported to police in England and Wales has dropped by around 20% in recent weeks.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-52220857,Linkin Park: New Chester Bennington music 'did my friend justice',"When Linkin Park singer Chester Bennington took his own life in 2017, most fans probably thought they would never hear new music from him again. But this weekend a new album, featuring vocals Chester recorded more than 20 years ago, is being streamed around the world. It's based on songs he wrote with Grey Daze, the band he was in before Linkin Park - and features guest stars from the music industry and Chester's family. It felt like it gave me a little bit of closure with losing him, something that I was able to work on for a couple of years in his honour, Grey Daze's drummer Sean Dowdell tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. And I feel like I did my friend justice, you know? During their career, Linkin Park sold tens of millions of albums, won two Grammy Awards and released a collaboration album with Jay-Z. But Sean says - even with all this going on - it was actually Chester's idea to reform their 90s band Grey Daze. In 2016, we decided we wanted make sure people got to hear this music, he says. Chester never got the chance to re-record his vocals - but Sean still wanted to finish the project however he could. That meant keeping the original vocals intact but re-recording absolutely everything else. That's one of the reasons this took two and a half years because we were in uncharted territory - we had to reverse engineer these songs. And I think we did a great job. I think we created a masterpiece. The album, called Amends, features not only Grey Daze's original line-up, but also Chester's friends from bands including Korn and Breaking Benjamin - and even members of his family. About halfway through the recording process a kind of a lightning bolt hit me in the chest, Sean says. I realised we could actually give something back to Chester during this process. We realised we could have his children come in and sing these songs with him - something he never got to do while he was alive. So we had Chester's son Jaime come in to sing backing vocals on a track called Soul Song and I think his dad would be very proud of the job he did. Sean says going back to the old music was sometimes difficult - but eventually it felt like he and Chester were working together again. We wrote all the lyrics together and while I was writing from more of a philosophical point of view, I can clearly see, now he's gone, that these were real pain points that he was living in his life. When you're writing it, it has one meaning and then after you lose your friend, and you look back, it takes on a whole new meaning. The album was originally supposed to be released on April 10 but, because of the coronavirus lockdown, this has been pushed back to June. Not wanting to disappoint people, though, the band are holding virtual listening parties this weekend, where fans can sign up to hear the record before it comes out. Chester was not a rock star in my world he was just one of my best friends, Sean says. One of the tragic things about Chester was he was so giving for other people and put them so much higher than himself that he never really got to a point of appreciating himself or loving himself. That's the one tragedy in all of this is that Chester really never felt like he was enough for anybody and it's one of the things that led him down this path with his depression. But he was a wonderful man. Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52266314,Coronavirus: UK enters fourth week of lockdown ahead of review,"The UK is facing its fourth week in lockdown, with the government set to review by Thursday whether social distancing measures can be changed. Ministers are required by law to assess whether the rules are working, based on expert advice, after three weeks of telling Britons to stay at home. It comes as an NHS boss has warned staff are facing a hand-to-mouth supply of protective gowns. Meanwhile, the PM has thanked NHS staff after being discharged from hospital. The mother of a nurse who Boris Johnson specifically praised said she was exceptionally proud of her daughter. Wales' health minister said last week that the coronavirus lockdown would remain for several more weeks at the very least. And Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned there was no likelihood or prospect of measures being lifted after the Easter weekend. On Sunday, the UK's total number of hospital deaths linked to coronavirus reached 10,612. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers in England which represents hospital trusts, told BBC Breakfast that the number of protective gowns - imported from China - available to NHS staff in some parts of the country has fallen critically low in recent days. Mr Hopson said that the NHS ordered a whole load of stock weeks ago, but delays have been caused by the gowns sometimes failing safety tests, while other batches have been mislabelled - meaning the NHS has ended up with additional masks. He added: If everything had been flowing exactly as had been ordered and if all of the material had properly passed its safety test, there would not be an issue. This is all really hand-to-mouth in terms of gown delivery, and we need to get to a more sustainable supply. Mr Johnson had spent a week at St Thomas' Hospital in London - including three nights in intensive care - where he was being treated for Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. It is unclear whether the prime minister - who is now recuperating at Chequers, his country home in Buckinghamshire - will take part in the lockdown review. In a video message to the nation recorded after he left hospital, 55-year-old Mr Johnson said it could have gone either way as he thanked NHS staff for saving his life. He singled out two nurses - Jenny McGee from New Zealand and Luis Pitarma from Portugal - for caring for him at his bedside for 48 hours at the most critical time. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is currently in charge of running the government, with aides reportedly expecting Mr Johnson to be out of action for as long as a month. Asked how long it would be before Mr Johnson returned to work, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it would be a clinical decision for his doctors to take with him. Speaking at the Downing Street briefing on Sunday, Mr Hancock insisted the government is operating perfectly efficiently within the strategy that he set out. Labour shadow cabinet minister Rachel Reeves said her party is calling on the government to publish its exit strategy for ending the lockdown. Under the current rules, people are urged to stay at home and to only go out if they have a reasonable excuse, which includes exercise, shopping for basic necessities, healthcare and essential travel to or from work. Ms Reeves suggested ways of easing restrictions could include rolling out mass testing, shielding the most vulnerable while others get back to normal life and lifting the restrictions temporarily but reintroducing them if the virus starts to spread again. Although it's not the moment now to end the lockdown we need to think about where we are going to be in two, three, four weeks' time and now start looking at that plan, she told BBC Breakfast. Speaking ahead of the Easter Bank holiday weekend, Mr Raab said it was still too early to lift lockdown restrictions, insisting they would need to stay in place until evidence showed the UK had moved beyond the peak of the virus. But ministers may also have to consider any economic fallout of the lockdown measures, with a report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) think-tank suggesting 25% of the UK economy could be lost by the summer due to the current controls in place. Business Secretary Alok Sharma, when asked about the NIESR report, told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show there would no doubt be economic repercussions following the lockdown measures. The BBC's political correspondent Ben Wright said it is expected that social distancing measures will be continued, but he added that ministers are having to weigh up their responsibility to fight the disease with protecting the economy. Recently widowed Hannah - not her real name - has told how her husband of more than 40 years died after contracting coronavirus. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that her husband was in hospital for about a week before he died, and was put on a CPAP machine, which delivers oxygen to the lungs without needing a ventilator, to aid his breathing during that time. Describing his death, she said his breathing was really laboured. It is not a nice, quiet way to go, she said. Hannah added: This is such a cruel disease. Apart from the medical staff that he saw when he had to, [my husband] was alone for a week. I was alone at home, and I'm now alone at home. Nobody can give me a hug. My friends have rallied around, my church and everybody have been fabulous, but nobody can give me a hug. And I'm not lonely, I want to make that clear, I'm not lonely but I am alone. On Sunday, 737 new coronavirus-related hospital deaths were recorded, taking the total number to 10,612. Mr Hancock said it marked a sombre day for the nation, as it became the fifth country to surpass 10,000 deaths, joining the US, Spain, Italy and France. Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the UK was likely to be one of the worst, if not the worst affected country in Europe. The latest UK figures only include deaths recorded in hospitals, not those who died in care homes or in the community. Sam Monaghan, the head of the UK's largest charity care provider MHA, told BBC Breakfast that about 150 of its residents had died with confirmed or suspected coronavirus, as well as two staff members. He said the provider - which runs 90 care homes and 43 retirement living sites - was somewhat in the dark about the exact number of deaths, because not everyone who died was tested, although they may have been showing symptoms.

Cleese, who co-starred with Brooke-Taylor in the 1960s and 70s, said he was a great performer and companion. Fry described him as a hero for as long as I can remember, while Mitchell said the world has been robbed. The former member of 1970s trio The Goodies died on Sunday after contracting coronavirus. Cleese, who met the comedian at Cambridge University and went on to appear with him on stage and screen, said the news meant he had just lost the will to be silly. Fry added that Brooke-Taylor was gentle, kind, funny, wise, warm, but piercingly witty when he chose to be. Mitchell, who appeared alongside Brooke-Taylor on BBC Radio 4's panel show I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue, described him as a wonderful comedian and a really lovely man. The surviving members of The Goodies mourned their co-star. Bill Oddie remembered him as a true visual comic and a great friend, while Graeme Garden said he was terribly saddened by the loss of a dear colleague and close friend of over 50 years. The madcap sketch show began in 1970 and ran for 12 years, bringing the trio prime-time TV success. Brooke-Taylor had previously starred with Garden, Oddie and Cleese, among others, on BBC radio comedy I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again in the 1960s. That later led to Radio 4's long-running I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue. Brooke-Taylor appeared on the first edition in 1972 and remained a regular guest. The show's host Jack Dee said Brooke-Taylor was a delightful man and never anything but great company. He said: Tim brought a unique quality to Clue. He was a proper team player, very generous as a performer, never egotistical and always more than delighted to set himself up as the butt of the joke. For me, his great comedy gift was playing the injured innocent and he did it with brilliance and a characteristic lightness of touch. It's always heartbreaking to lose a loved one, but these times have created the cruellest of circumstances for that to happen in and my thoughts are with his wife Christine and all his family. One of his biggest contributions to British comedy was co-writing and performing the famous Four Yorkshiremen sketch with John Cleese, Chapman and Marty Feldman, originally for the ITV comedy programme At Last The 1948 Show!

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52242406,"Coronavirus: 'I lost my job, now we're on the bare minimum'","I've applied for universal credit, I got a mortgage holiday, I am applying for a council tax deferral, but it won't be enough, says Junior Stewart, 45, from Luton. The five of us are on the bare minimum, I don't know how we'll get by. Junior is one of the many now struggling because they do not qualify for emergency government support offered to workers affected by the coronavirus outbreak. Two weeks ago he lost his new sales job because he had not been there long enough to be furloughed or put on state-paid leave, having started after 28 February. As he was previously self-employed, he couldn't ask an old employer to furlough him. And he says there is no freelance work to go back to. Making things tougher, Junior's wife had a baby boy in February and is only getting half her normal salary while on maternity leave. We won't have enough to pay for our gas and electric, our car repayments, he says. On top of those expenses, the couple also have three kids to feed. I thought about getting a job at a supermarket but don't want to bring the virus home, Junior explains. You have to put on a brave face for the kids, but it is a stressful time. As large parts of the economy have been shut down to battle Covid-19, the government has provided a huge package of support for those who have lost their jobs or income. Millions should benefit but some have not been able to get help because they don't meet the strict eligibility criteria, or were laid off. Cheryl Carroll, 39, from South East London is self employed but cannot access the SEISS scheme, which would let her claim a taxable grant worth 80% of her trading profits, up to £2,500 per month for three months. The events director has only worked for herself for 16 months, which means she does not have accounts going back further than 2019. This means she is unable to fulfil a government requirement for support. All events have been stopped and I have no income coming in, she says. I applied for universal credit but it will take at least five weeks, and from what I can gather, it will only be £75 a week. Cheryl got a three month mortgage holiday from the bank and lives alone, with no dependents. But she is using her savings to pay her outgoings and fears she won't have enough left to pay her next tax bill when it's due. It's a worrying time and I feel a bit abandoned by the government, she says. Cheryl says she could sell her house if things got really bad, but she does not want to. There are five million self-employed people in the UK and the government says 95% will be eligible for emergency support. But research from the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed suggests 45% of self-employed workers think they won't have enough money to cover basic costs during the crisis, despite the help on offer. That includes directors of small limited companies, who take their income fully or partially in dividends, which the government will not cover. Michelle Donald, 41, says turnover at the small recruitment company she runs with her husband in Norfolk dropped to virtually zero overnight when the crisis hit. Whilst we are lucky in the sense that our overheads are small, the lack of support from the government for our personal income is what will ruin us, the company director says. Because she pays herself a small basic salary alongside her dividends, she will be able to furlough herself and claim 80% of that income - about £800 a month. But her husband can't do the same, as he has to continue his duties to try to keep business afloat. We are not wealthy by any stretch. We have three kids in the house and our monthly outgoings will be about £1,500 a month if we get a mortgage holiday, says Michelle. We have a little bit of savings but it's all we have got. If we have to use those, we will come out of this with literally not a penny to our name. She thinks company directors have been discriminated against because people think they don't pay as much tax and national insurance, when in fact the difference is minimal. She and her husband also put lots of their own money into building the business ,which could very well go under. A petition urging the government to cover dividend income through the coronavirus job retention scheme has been signed by 320,000 people. A Treasury spokeswoman said: The chancellor has outlined an unprecedented package of measures to protect millions of people's jobs and incomes as part of the national effort in response to coronavirus. Those who do not qualify for the support schemes will be able to access a range of other measures - including an increase in the universal credit allowance, income tax deferrals, £1bn more support for renters and access to three-month mortgage holidays."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-52230283,Coronavirus: Mum creates bedroom jungle for daughter's birthday,"A mother who posted pictures of her daughter's jungle bedroom transformation on social media said she has been overwhelmed by the response. Aurora Eaton's sixth birthday party was cancelled because of the lockdown. Instead, Jodie Eaton, from Ipswich, created the sensory jungle for her daughter who has a visual impairment. Aurora said her favourites were the tigers and snake - and gave her mother a million out of 10 for the transformation. Mrs Eaton said the post has been liked by more than 23,000 people, with about 2,000 comments. Aurora, whose birthday is on 23 April, had requested a party in a bakery. When it had to be cancelled Mrs Eaton and husband Aaron offered to redecorate her bedroom instead - and a jungle was requested. The drama teacher said it was lucky she was able to get everything she needed before the lockdown began. I would do an hour of school work with the girls - and then fit in an hour here and there over three weeks to create the bedroom, she said. I'm usually an outdoors person so having this to do in the first three weeks really helped. Aurora, who has a visual impairment called microphthalmia, needed a bunk bed with a staircase rather than a ladder. A friend sold them a second-hand bed - and the transformation, including the bed, cost less than £100. Mrs Eaton believed the planned party would have cost the family between £200 and £300. She added: One of the loveliest things is that after the photos were posted, six or seven people with children with microphthalmia got in touch, so we've made that connection. Microphthalmia is an impairment in which one or both eyeballs are unusually small. Mrs Eaton said: Aurora goes to Moorfields Eye Hospital every six months for a new glass eye and also has poor sight in her other eye - so she's a brave one and feisty."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-52268841,Coronavirus: Thirteen die at Stanley care home,"Thirteen residents of a County Durham care home have now died after displaying symptoms of coronavirus. Managers at Stanley Park care home in Stanley said they were devastated by the deaths. The first death was in late March with the latest confirmed by home operator Care UK on Monday. It has not been disclosed how many other residents at the 72-bed home are ill. One resident who tested positive for the virus is in hospital. Five deaths were announced overnight on Sunday before the 13th was later reported on Monday. Care UK said the latest resident to die had been living in the home and had some symptoms that could indicate Covid-19, though no test had been carried out. Care UK regional director Karen Morrison said: We are completely devastated that this many residents have lost their lives to what we believe to be Covid-19. My heart goes out to the families and friends of residents who have passed away over the past few days. We are all thinking of them at this difficult time and send our condolences and best wishes. The team at the home continue to be absolutely amazing and I cannot thank them enough. Despite all that has happened, they continue to deliver the very best care in a kind and professional way. They have had all the necessary PPE and have been using it meticulously ever since the first case was seen at the end of last month.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52239262,Deadly tornadoes batter southern US states,"At least 13 people have died after storms triggered tornadoes and flooding across several southern US states. Tornadoes ripped through Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi on Sunday, while severe storms also hit parts of Alabama and Georgia on Monday. More than 900,000 households were without power on Monday morning local time. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency (MSEMA) confirmed deaths across three counties on Sunday. US media reported a man in Georgia was killed on Monday morning when a tree fell on a house. In Louisiana, a number of homes were destroyed in the city of Monroe. The city's official social media account initially reported only minor injuries. CNN reports that the storms are moving north, and are threatening to hit states on the East Coast. In Mississippi, three deaths were confirmed in Jefferson Davis County, two in Lawrence and one in Walthall. Last week, the American Meteorological Society (AMS) issued guidelines for taking shelter during the coronavirus pandemic. The vast majority of residents in the US are under stay-at-home orders. Do not let the virus prevent you from seeking refuge from a tornado, the AMS said. It advised making shelter plans in advance in homes or with neighbours, friends or families. Public shelters in many communities are closed because of lockdown measures. MSEMA urged people to continue to follow social distancing guidelines, even if they need to seek safety in a public shelter. Alabama Governor Kay Ivey declared a state of emergency on Sunday that suspended Covid-19 mitigation measures that may have prevented people from gathering in public shelters in the state."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51205344,Coronavirus: Who needs masks or other protective gear?,"Face masks, gloves and other protective gear can help stop the spread of coronavirus in the right circumstances, but there has been a lot of discussion about who should use them. World Health Organization (WHO) special envoy Dr David Nabarro has suggested that more widespread use of masks will become the norm as the world adjusts to living with Covid-19. Coronavirus is spread by droplets that can spray into the air when those infected talk, cough and sneeze. These can enter the body through the eyes, nose and mouth, either directly or after touching a contaminated object The World Health Organization says it remains the case that medical masks should be reserved for healthcare workers, not the general public. Only two groups of people should wear protective masks, those who are: Masks are not recommended for the general public because: Dr Nabarro told Radio 4's Today programme that healthcare workers and those with symptoms remained the priority, especially given the worldwide shortage of the best quality masks. But he said masks might also need to be worn by non-medical workers who are in frequent contact with others and who can't distance themselves, such as people operating cash registers, or hairdressers. Among society as a whole, he said that he expected some form of facial protection is going to become the norm, not least to offer people reassurance when they encounter others. But Dr Nabarro warned against complacency: Don't imagine that you can do what you like when you are wearing a mask. [It] doesn't give you the excuse to disregard social distancing. Americans are advised to use clean cloth or fabric to cover their faces whilst in public. Officials say medical masks are in short supply and should be left for healthcare workers. Only the sick, or those caring for patients of coronavirus, had previously been told to wear masks. But US officials hope the new rules could stop people without symptoms unknowingly spreading coronavirus. However, reusable cloth masks are also not recommended and may even increase the chance of infection, say European advisers. They say there is a high chance virus particles could go through cloth. Problems with moisture could also mean the cloth retains the virus, they warn. The UK is not advising most people to wear either medical or homemade masks. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says the government is following medical and scientific advice on their use. England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van Tam says he does not believe that healthy people wearing them in the UK would reduce the spread of the disease. What matters now is social distancing, he says. However, the authorities in Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia have told their citizens to wear masks outside. Morocco, Indonesia and Vietnam have also ordered people to wear them. There is lots of advice on how to make face masks online, with some sites suggesting the best options. However, homemade masks are not regulated whereas officially-made ones have to meet safety requirements. In hospitals, different types of mask offer different grades of protection. The most protective is an FFP3 or, alternatively, an N95 or an FFP2. Experts do not recommend the public use these masks. They are for healthcare workers in close contact with coronavirus patients and at highest risk of encountering infected airborne droplets. Other NHS staff in lower-risk situations can wear a surgical mask, latest guidelines say. That means healthcare workers within one metre of a patient with possible or confirmed Covid-19, and it includes staff working in hospitals, primary care, ambulance trusts, community care settings and care homes. Gloves and other protective wear are recommended for NHS staff working in places where they could encounter coronavirus. Again, staff in the highest-risk scenarios are advised to wear fuller protection, rather than a simple apron, gloves, mask and goggles. The general public are not advised to wear gloves or any other protective gear. To protect yourself from coronavirus, the NHS recommends:"

A total of 10,612 people confirmed to have had the virus have died. The actual number of those with the respiratory infection in the UK is estimated to be much higher though - as it is mostly those in hospital and some NHS staff who are currently being tested.

Northern Ireland local authority figures Monday to Friday only. If you can't see the look-up click here. The following charts and graphics will help you understand the situation in the UK and how the authorities are responding. The number of people confirmed to have had coronavirus and died has risen by 737 to 10,612. The UK becomes the fifth country to surpass 10,000 deaths, joining the US, Spain, Italy and France. The BBC's head of statistics Robert Cuffe says that although growth in the number of deaths has stalled over the last few days, it is possible that some deaths may be unreported until the end of the Bank Holiday weekend. The majority of the deaths have been in England, with 9,594 deaths in total. In Scotland, 566 people have died so far, while the figure in Wales is 369. Northern Ireland has seen a total of 118 deaths. Most deaths have been among the elderly. Figures released by NHS England show more than half of deaths have been among people aged over 80. The UK's overall death figure, which is confirmed cases reported up to 17:00 BST the previous day, is almost entirely made up from those people who died in hospital and tested positive for coronavirus. For the most part it does not include deaths in the community, for example in care homes, or people who have died in their own homes. This means that the true death toll will be higher. Most deaths so far have occurred in London, but the Midlands has also been badly affected. The new coronavirus, which causes the respiratory disease known as Covid-19, was first confirmed in the UK at the end of January. While there were a number of people testing positive throughout February, figures in the UK began to increase at the beginning of March. Prime Minister Boris Johnson who tested positive for the virus has been released from hospital after spending three nights in intensive care. He thanked hospital workers for saving his life. A number of temporary Nightingale hospitals are being set up across the country to increase the NHS's ability to deal with the crisis. The new hospitals will treat patients in makeshift critical care units at: Another hospital will also be established at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff - though this is not classed as a Nightingale facility. Retired NHS staff have been asked to return to work. A government appeal for volunteers to help deliver food and medicine to the vulnerable has prompted more than 750,000 responses. At the moment, the number of confirmed cases and deaths in the UK remains lower than some other European countries. For example, in Italy there have been more than 150,000 confirmed cases and nearly 20,000 deaths. But while the increase in the number of deaths each day appears to be slowing in Italy, in the UK the number is still rising - albeit at a slower rate than a week ago. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has set a target of 100,000 tests per day by the end of April - a big jump from the previous target of 25,000 per day by mid-April. On 11 April more than 18,000 coronavirus tests were carried out and in total about 282,000 people in the UK have been tested. Most of the tests so far have been reserved for seriously ill patients in hospital. But on Friday the government began to publish figures which included key workers and their households, as well as hospital patients. Previously, the testing of key workers and their families had not been included in the daily figures. Increasing the number of people being tested for coronavirus will play a key part in analysing its spread in the UK. The government's action plan for dealing with the virus involves three phases - contain; delay; mitigate - alongside ongoing research. After trying to contain the disease, the country moved to the delay phase on 12 March to stop the wider spread of the virus. Even if you have no symptoms, the government says you should: Police have been given powers to fine people deliberately flouting the restrictions, with increasing penalties for repeat offenders. The government is now encouraging self-isolation at home for over 70s, and those more vulnerable to the virus, for 12 weeks. British nationals should avoid all non-essential foreign travel to tackle the spread of coronavirus, the Foreign Office has advised. Symptoms include a high temperature and a new, continuous cough - this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or three or more coughing episodes in 24 hours (if you usually have a cough, it may be worse than usual). If you think you have coronavirus you are advised not to go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital. Instead, you stay at home for seven days. If you live with other people, you should keep at least 2m away from them and they should also stay home for 14 days to see if they develop symptoms. If your symptoms persist or worsen you should contact the NHS's dedicated 111 online coronavirus service or call 111."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52267376,Coronavirus: Spain begins to ease lockdown to revive economy,"Spain, one of the countries worst hit by the coronavirus, is beginning to ease strict lockdown measures that have brought its economy to a standstill. People in manufacturing, construction and some services are being allowed to return to work, but must stick to strict safety guidelines. The rest of the population must still remain at home. Almost 17,500 people with Covid-19 have died in Spain, but the rate of new infections has been falling. Italy - the hardest hit country in Europe, with almost 19,900 deaths - will allow a narrow range of firms to resume operations on Tuesday. Spain's health ministry said on Monday that the daily number of deaths had dipped slightly, with 517 reported in the previous 24 hours, compared with 619 announced on Sunday. The official total death toll is now 17,489. The number of new infections continues to drop, with 3,477 confirmed cases bringing the total to 169,496. We are still far from victory, from the moment when we will recover normality in our lives, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez warned over the weekend. We are all keen to go back out on the streets... but our desire is even greater to win the war and prevent a relapse, he added. On Monday, the government lifted some of the restrictions put in place on 27 March and allowed businesses whose employees cannot work remotely to reopen. Officials intend to distribute 10 million face masks on public transport. The head of the regional administration in Catalonia, Quim Torra, said he would not comply with any easing of the lockdown for non-essential workers, warning that the risk of a new outbreak and a second lockdown is enormous. Mr Sánchez said the decision was taken after consulting a committee of experts. He also noted that Spain had not entered the second phase of the fight against the coronavirus, when there would be any further loosening of the lockdown. That was at least two weeks away and would be very gradual, he added. Builders can only work in areas away from local residents, so they cannot yet go back to doing home improvements. By Guy Hedgecoe in Madrid The lifting of some lockdown restrictions in Spain today has meant a return to normality of sorts for many non-essential workers. Two weeks ago they were told to stay at home as the national lockdown was tightened. On the Madrid metro and at bus and railway stations, police handed out face masks to commuters as part of a national strategy. However, even at rush hour, use of Madrid's transport system was much lower than normal. Antonio Álvarez, a self-employed manual worker, described it as a relief to be able to resume work on the digging of a swimming pool on a private property near the capital. I think the restrictions so far have worked. If they hadn't implemented them it would have been disastrous, he said. Easter is a major holiday in the Spanish calendar, usually packed with religious events and marking the beginning of a busy tourist season. But this year, for the first time since the 1930s, there were no Easter processions and bars, restaurants, beaches and squares across the country were empty. As an alternative, some churches streamed Catholic Mass into the homes of worshippers, while websites replayed footage of religious processions from previous years. Italy reported 431 new deaths on Sunday - the lowest for more than three weeks. However, the country is almost certain to join the United States on Monday with a death toll of more than 20,000. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said last week that the lockdown would continue until 3 May, but that a few types of shops and businesses would be allowed to reopen on Tuesday. They would include bookshops, stationers and shops selling children's clothes, he said. Factories will not reopen, although Mr Conte said he would continue to assess the trend of new infections and act accordingly if conditions allowed it. In Germany, where 3,022 people with Covid-19 have died, pressure is also growing from businesses for a plan on how to exit the country's lockdown. On Wednesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel will discuss a strategy with regional leaders. Elsewhere in Europe, the number of people who have died with the virus in the Netherlands rose by 86 to 2,823 on Monday. The total number of cases increased by almost 1,000 to 26,551. And in France, which is expected to extend its lockdown until 10 May, police said dozens of worshippers defied the measures to attend a secret Easter Mass on Saturday. A priest was fined while other churchgoers were given a warning, the AFP news agency reports."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-51235105,Coronavirus pandemic: Tracking the global outbreak,"There are nearly 1.9 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in 185 countries and at least 114,000 people have died. The United States now has about three times as many confirmed cases as any other country. This series of maps and charts tracks the spread of the virus since it emerged in China in December last year. Please upgrade your browser to see the full interactive Source: Johns Hopkins University Figures last updated 13 Apr 2020 The virus is spreading rapidly in many countries and the death toll is still climbing - but the majority of people are recovering from the infection. The country with the highest number of cases is the US, according to figures collated by Johns Hopkins University. With about 560,000 confirmed cases, it has nearly seven times the official number recorded in China. China's official death toll from the outbreak is just over 3,300 - but the US, Italy, Spain, France and UK have each recorded more than 10,000 deaths. Critics of the Chinese government, however, have questioned whether the country's official numbers can be trusted. This information is regularly updated but may not reflect the latest totals for each country. Source: Johns Hopkins University, national public health agencies. France now includes cases confirmed and suspected in retirement and nursing homes. Last updated on 13 April 2020, 15:00 BST. The outbreak was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March. This is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. The WHO said it took more than three months to reach the first 100,000 confirmed cases worldwide, but it took less than a week for the number to double from 500,000 to a million. It then took seven days to reach 1.5 million. The true figure for the number of people with coronavirus is thought to be much higher as many of those with milder symptoms have not been tested and counted. China has now lifted many of the stringent measures it took to bring the disease under control. Last week, authorities eased travel restrictions in Wuhan, the city where the outbreak began in late 2019. South Korea, where a major outbreak began in February, has also seen the number of new cases fall in recent weeks. Governments across the world have halted flights, locked down towns and cities and urged people to stay at home. European countries have seen steep rises in cases and deaths, but slowing infection rates are raising hopes that strict social distancing measures are curbing the spread of the virus. Italy has the highest toll outside the US, with nearly 20,000 deaths so far, but recent data suggests the infection rate is slowing. The country has been in lockdown since 9 March but Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said last week that he might begin to relax some measures by the end of this month. Spain's death toll is not far behind, on 17,500 - the third highest of any country. There are now nearly 170,000 confirmed cases in Spain, but data shows the rate of new cases is falling. The Spanish government is beginning to ease the strict lockdown that has been in place in the country since 14 March. People in manufacturing, construction and some services are being allowed to return to work, but must stick to strict safety guidelines. The rest of the population must still remain at home. In the UK, there have been more than 85,000 confirmed cases and more than 10,000 deaths. Like Spain, deaths in the UK grew rapidly at first, doubling faster than every two days. That rate of increase has now slowed. The UK's first emergency field hospital, built in London's ExCel Centre, is now open. The NHS Nightingale hospital, as it has been called, has space for 4,000 intensive care beds. Others are planned across the UK. With nearly 560,000 cases, the US has the highest number of confirmed infections in the world. In fact, New York state alone has more cases than any other country, with 190,000 so far. But Andrew Cuomo, the state's governor, says New York City is now witnessing a flattening curve of cases as the effects of social distancing measures begin to be seen. The number of deaths from the virus in the US now stands at more than 22,000, and the rate is doubling about every three days at present. Nearly all Americans are now living under some form of lockdown as states increase efforts to curb the outbreak. President Trump has said he wants the economy to reopen with a big bang - but that would have to wait until the US was on the downward slope in terms of infections. Federal coronavirus guidelines, such as social distancing, will be in place across the country until at least 30 April. The outbreak is having a major economic impact, with figures showing the number of people without jobs surging to a record high of more than 6.6 million in the week ending 4 April. It was the third week in a row that the figure was higher than the previous record, set in 1982, when unemployment claims hit 695,000. The majority of countries in Europe now have strict lockdowns in place, with many only allowing citizens to leave their homes to buy essential items or exercise. In Paris, authorities have even banned exercise during the day to reduce the number of people out on the streets. India's government told the country's 1.3 billion residents to stay at home last month and there are similar restrictions on movement and social contact across the world in countries like Argentina, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia and South Africa. Data on planned journeys in major cities, from the travel app Citymapper, shows how people in places like London, Madrid, Istanbul and New York are now moving around far less than they were a few weeks ago. The data shows that while Milan in northern Italy has been locked down for several weeks now, many other cities have been restricting movement for a much shorter period. While movement is also down in the South Korean capital Seoul, the city hasn't ground to a halt like European capitals despite facing huge numbers of coronavirus cases - a sign of the country's decision to focus on widespread testing and contact tracing rather than imposing a lockdown. In Russia, the Kremlin had insisted that there was de facto no epidemic in the country but President Putin has urged people to stay at home, which explains the significant drop in movement in Moscow."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51506729,Coronavirus: What are social distancing and self-isolation rules?,"Sunny and warm weather in parts of the UK this Easter weekend has prompted the government to appeal for people to stick to restrictions on movement to curb the spread of coronavirus. Police also have wide-ranging powers to help fight coronavirus by enforcing the social distancing measures. These say people should go out as little as possible and only leave if they have a reasonable excuse. This includes: If you have to go outside you should stay more than 2m (6ft) apart from anyone other than members of your own household. This is what's known as social distancing. No mention is given to how long you can exercise for. But Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has suggested a walk of up to an hour, a run of 30 minutes or a cycle ride of between that might be appropriate more most people depending on their level of fitness. Social distancing is important because coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can be breathed in, or can cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on, and then touch your face with unwashed hands. If you show symptoms of coronavirus - such as a dry cough and high temperature - you must take extra precautions. You should stay at home and if possible, not leave it for any reason. This is known as self-isolation. If possible, you should not go out even to buy food or other essentials. If you are unable to get supplies delivered, you should do what you can to limit social contact when you do leave the house. Everyone who shows coronavirus symptoms - a fever of above 37.8C, a persistent cough or breathing problems - and everyone who lives in the same house or flat as someone with symptoms. The person with the symptoms should stay in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened, and keep away from other people in the home. People are being advised not to ring NHS 111 or their GP to report their symptoms unless they are worried. About 1.5 million people with very serious health conditions are being contacted by the NHS and urged not go out at all for at least 12 weeks. This is what's known as shielding. The most vulnerable group includes: The government says it will work with local authorities, supermarkets and the armed forces to ensure they get supplies of essential food and medicines. Others in the same household, and carers, can go out as long they observe proper social distancing."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-52220736,Cadet Rated Legend album: Krept on his cousin's life and legacy,"On 9 February 2019, Blaine Johnson, better known as Cadet, was on his way to perform a gig at Keele University when the taxi he was in crashed, killing him and injuring the other passengers in the car. More than a year later, as his debut album Rated Legend is released, Cadet's cousin Krept reflects on their at-times complicated relationship. As told to Kameron Virk… It's hard putting private things out in the open. I do it in my music because I know how much people look at artists and think that everything's great. But when you're open and honest and let them know that you're going through just as much stuff as they're going through, it helps. It can literally save lives. That's why I've been so honest about how hard it's been for me since Cadet died. As his debut album comes out, I want to just take a minute to reflect on his life and our relationship. Some people have such mad stories that they have to figure out a way to talk about them. Cadet was 100% one of those people. He was such a talented storyteller. Anyone who's heard his music knows that. When you come from a certain place, a certain background, and you go through so much stuff… if you like doing music, you like rapping, to put it into words is not gonna be difficult. I think that's what separates a lot of people. It's just their story. But before the world knew him as Cadet, he was Blaine Johnson, my cousin. And for a period he was MC Bubbly too! Yeah. MC Bubbly. When he spat his first bar, at my dad's house in Brixton, that's what he was called. The lyric was actually good - but I was like 'Bro, you can't be called MC Bubbly'. Blaine was less than a month younger than me. So growing up we were always together. Like, always. His dad and my dad are brothers, but our mums are close too. I've got an older brother, and we were all really close. But my brother spent some time in Jamaica, and it was just me and Blaine together. It was like he was my brother. We used to spend every Sunday at my nan's. Those Sundays were a vibe. We all used to go there - Cadet, me, my dad, his dad, Cadet's sister Chandler, our nan and granddad, our auntie - sometimes other cousins too. My nan used to cook every Sunday so there was always food there. But it wasn't even just for that reason: we just used to go there, play games and buss jokes - and Cadet would be dancing. He was always dancing when we were younger. The guy loved body-popping. And he was so sick! He could've been a professional dancer if he stuck with it. I used to body pop a bit too - but he was to the point where when we used to go parties, he used to get in the middle and start body popping and everyone would go crazy. There's something else that sticks with me from that age too - an image I just can't get out of my head. I don't know why my dad did it - Cadet must've been being naughty. But we were at the petrol station, and you know where it says how much the petrol is per litre? There was a little peg on there. He lifted Blaine up and hung him on there by his pants. I just remember Blaine swinging helplessly and crying and I can't get that out of my head. I used to laugh about it every day. When we got a bit older I took advantage of the 417 bus, which went from my house in Gipsy Hill to his in Clapham Common. It dropped me literally right outside. So from when I was allowed to travel by myself, in secondary school, I'd get on there and it would take me all the way there, or he'd come to mine. Then when Cadet started living with his dad in South Norwood we used to walk to Crystal Palace from my house and jump on the 410 bus down to his dad's. Those buses are where his name came from - their brand name was Cadet. We were just on the bus and I saw the Cadet thing and I just said, Cadet! Why don't you call yourself Cadet? He was like Cadet?…. Yeah. Yeah, that's hard! We must've been 14 or 15, and ever since then he's been Cadet. I started rapping before him, just because all my friends were. They were doing sets in the ends and I was like, I need some bars to jump in the set. That's when I started writing. And then he saw all of us were spitting, so he started. The maddest thing is even when his name was MC Bubbly, the lyrics were good - I knew from then he could spit. We went to Richmond College together when we turned 16 and made a whole new friendship group. Things started changing after that though. I went to uni in Portsmouth, and Cadet started working. So we just didn't see each other. Me and Konan started making a name for ourselves at this point too. We put out our first mixtape in my first year of uni. So I'm doing uni, I'm doing music, and then we're just getting into mad problems and involved in street stuff too. It was like three different lives I was living. It was balancing bare stuff. It looked like me and Konan were already successful - and any time me and Cadet spoke, it felt like he was asking for stuff. 'Oh, can you do this for me. Can you promote that?' But we weren't making no money, we were still building. We weren't even seeing each other on Sundays now, because I was in Portsmouth. My family thought I was distancing myself. Cadet didn't fully understand until a few years later, when he was in the groundwork stage of his own career - as I call that period in mine - that I was just working. He talks about it on the new album. But we weren't speaking openly at the time. There was a communication breakdown. He used to make songs or freestyles every now and then and send shots for me. And I was like, why does he keep doing that? And then he'd ask me to promote it! I was like 'Are you alright?' It was weird. It really took off for me and Kone in the next few years. We did the remix of Otis, which went crazy viral. But it was a mad period - this was just after the situation happened with Konan, where his step-dad was killed. But we capitalised on the Otis momentum, dropped Paranormal, and ended up going on tour with Skepta. He gave us some advice - basically told us to keep doing us and not chase the labels or the radio - and we never really looked back. Mobo Awards, BET Awards and a record deal followed. But I never got a call from Cadet. I'm definitely someone who thinks 'Everyone's got their own life'. I don't expect nothing from anyone. But that was the person I was closest to my whole life, and I didn't get to share that with him. We'd still see each other sometimes, round nan's on a Sunday. And when we were together it was normal. But for me relationships aren't just about when you see each other - it's about when you're not with each other too. I'm sure at some point he would have said 'I'm proud of you'. But it wasn't how it would have been if we were close. I know that for a fact. At this point I'd had enough. I just kept thinking, 'Why are we like this? How did it get like this?' I missed that relationship - and I knew it had gone because of the music. The only thing that was gonna build our relationship back was him doing music and taking it seriously. That's when I messaged him and said 'Bro, you're coming Wireless'. I needed to inspire him. I knew how talented he was, and that if he took it seriously, he would get big. Sometimes you just need that little fire. Wireless that year was mad - there were loads of celebrities backstage. When he saw them coming up to us, he was like, 'What's going on? These man are actually getting big!' There must've been 5,000 people in the crowd that day, singing every single word back. All our friends watched us perform from the side of the stage. Cadet was the last person to leave - I could see it had worked. He was inspired. Things felt pretty normal after that. We started talking all the time - mostly about his music. As far as I was concerned, our relationship was fixed. But he was still sending shots for me on freestyles - like on Slut. I thought that was just about music, so I was like, whatever. As long as you're doing music, you can say what you want. But I didn't know all of the stuff he thought had been going on. That's when the letters came. He told me he was dropping something, to look out for it. From when I saw the title, Letter To Krept, I just knew it was gonna be honest. I was in my house in Bermondsey and watched it as soon as it was uploaded. I wanted to hear it. And then I just started writing. I was glad he did it because then it was like, now I can explain my side to you. When I heard the lyric about his girlfriend - that he thought I knew she was cheating on him, I was like, 'Rah, swear down you thought that?' Until the letter came out I had no idea he'd been thinking that the whole time. I was happy with the way it played out though. He likes expressing and telling his truth in music, and I do as well. So I was cool with how that happened. At the same time I knew that if I responded to him it was only gonna help his career. After I said what I needed to in my reply - about him asking for my help but not putting the work in himself - the air was cleared. It was back to normal. We didn't even need to build anything back up - because we'd been so close for the rest of our lives, except for that six-year period in the middle. It was the same as it was before, just with no weird elephants in the room. We finally got to witness each other flourish. I got to share those big moments I'd always wanted to with him. At this point Cadet was hitting hard with the freestyles. He knew his lane, he knew what his fans wanted, and he was delivering. And when it came to storytelling, he was in his own lane. When he spat I had to just sit back like, 'Wow. That's talent'. But he felt underrated. He didn't think he was getting his dues. I remember we all had a conversation and I said how if you tell people something enough, it becomes true. As an example, Giggs calling himself the Landlord - you end up calling him that. That was when he started calling himself Underrated Legend. It was a smart move from Cadet to put that out there, because then everyone starts saying he needs his ratings! But Cadet's thing was, 'Rapping about my life is cool, but that's not really getting me the bookings. We're not going to be able to shut down the clubs or the festivals with that.' Until Advice came. That was the hit he'd been looking for. He'd been dabbling, and he got it so right with that one. But it was almost never a song. Cadet and Deno done it as a freestyle in the car, put the video on social, and left it at that. Konan rang him and was like 'Bro. Cadet. Bro. This is a banger! Record a video and put this out ASAP'. He did, and it was his biggest song ever. After that, he just kept on going. He started feeling like he was finally getting the recognition he deserved. You see when you start getting records like that back? You start getting serious money. He was like, 'Rah, I'm about to actually join the crew'. He started getting bookings - he was booked for Wireless - and he started feeling like a real artist. I'm glad he got to feel that. He was chasing it and he got there, he knew what it felt like to have a massive record. That's something that makes the way he died so much easier for me. A month before Cadet died, I lost one of my closest friends, Nash, to suicide. I met Nash in college but we became mad tight. We were all in the same group chat - me, him and Cadet. I remember playing Broski, about Nash passing away, to Cadet. We played it and just sat back like, 'Wow. I can't believe he's gone'. Then a month later, it happened again. When I found out, I was in Dubai. My girlfriend took me for my birthday. The day before, Cadet messaged me saying, Yo cuz, I just want you to know I love you. I was like, 'You're dumb man. You're soft'. He told me he'd got me the socks I'd asked for for my birthday. The next day my friend CJ called as I was boarding my flight home. I knew something was wrong because it was late in the UK, like 2am. So for you to call me at 2am, knowing I'm abroad, something's wrong. And it's someone that doesn't call me a lot - we don't have phone conversations like that. So I know there's a reason he's calling me, and I know he's always with Cadet. I picked up and he was crying. I just knew. He didn't even have to tell me what happened. I knew exactly what he was going to say. I hung up the phone and nearly dropped to the floor. I had to put my bags down, take a seat and have a breather. My girlfriend was helping me. All I kept saying was there's no way. There's no way, there's no way, there's no way. I was trying to ring people, and eventually I got through to my dad. He was crying, and that made me cry. All this time I'm having to board a plane. It was the worst, absolute worst, worst, worst feeling I've ever had. By the time I landed home, I'd been seeing the response on social media. I could see all the love he had, I could feel it. But his mum, dad and our nan, they weren't seeing it. As adults they know that their kids are doing well as musicians, but they don't really know until they see you at a concert or something. So I needed them to see all the love that was being poured out on social media. That's why I said Hyde Park - 'Everyone come to Hyde Park, we're gonna let off some balloons for Cadet'. I needed them to see the impact that he made. At first they didn't understand why I was saying Hyde Park. They wanted to do something in Clapham. But I had to explain - this is bigger than South London. When they saw all the people they couldn't believe it. There must have been 1,000. They couldn't believe it, that he had so much love. My uncle never cries. That was the first time I've seen him break down. It was hard, it was so hard. It still is. I started to learn about what happened on the night he died. I had to speak to the people that were in the car with him. He was in a packed car and he's the only one that died. I spoke to his friend Money that was there, his DJ, and Ed his cameraman. They were all in the car. Cadet was behind the driver. The DJ was next to him, Money was on the left behind the front passenger and then Ed was in the passenger. What they found mad was the fact that they called an Uber, and they missed it. So the Uber they actually got in wasn't the original Uber they were meant to get in. They got into a second Uber and they were driving for like five minutes on country roads. They said they turned a corner and a car crashed into them. Head on collision. He died instantly. There wasn't any other major injuries. I know Ed fractured something. But no-one had life-threatening injuries. Cadet hit his head. That's what killed him. Whatever he hit is what killed him. But they weren't even meant to be in that Uber. It's like something out of Final Destination. You call an Uber, you just, JUST, about miss it. You cancel it and have to call another one and it just so happens that at that time, this guy is coming around the corner. If they got in a car one minute earlier that wouldn't have happened. If they got in that first cab, this wouldn't have happened. That's what I find mad. After the funeral I was just keeping busy. I was getting ready for his show, the Rated Legend show. We put it on in Brixton Academy on his birthday, two weeks later. It was like Avengers Assemble. Everybody was being helpful - the venue, my agent, all the artists, 1Xtra who helped with logistics. Everyone came on time, it was perfect. It was like 'Rah, all these people, these artists, they all had respect for Cadet'. After he passed, loads of producers started hitting us up saying they'd recorded songs with him. It ended up being 50, 60 songs or something. It just kept on being more and more. I was like, 'This guy was working his arse off! Why's he got so many songs?!' We tried to get a cohesive body of work out of it. That's what his mum and dad wanted. The family listened to all the songs and decided what they liked, and Rated Legend is the culmination of putting those together and finishing them off. We set up the Cadet Trust too - which funds organisations that are doing something good for young people or in the community. All these kids that we're funding and helping, when they get to where they get to in life, they're gonna be able to say 'Cadet helped me get here'. We just wanted to leave something in his name that can benefit people who are chasing their dreams. My first child is due later this year. Having something missing from your life and then having something added is a weird feeling. But I really can't wait for my daughter to arrive. It's going to help take my mind off loads of stuff, like my friends that I've lost. It feels like finally I'm gaining something instead of losing people. I know the relationship my daughter would have had with Cadet. He was so good with kids. I know for a fact, when she got old enough, he would have come over like, 'I'm taking her out'. That's the kind of person he is. He would've been an amazing uncle. For me, I just want people to know how special he is. That's what this album is. I want people to listen to it, and to hear this amazing body of work he made without even trying to. I want people to think, 'Wow, imagine if he'd been trying to make an album?' I want people to see how much potential he had. And I want people to no longer call him underrated - he's surpassed that now. Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-52236389,Coronavirus: The grandad who became a TikTok star without realising it,"The grandad who became a TikTok star without realising it In less than three months an 87-year-old grandfather has gathered a huge following on the video-sharing app TikTok, despite the fact that most of its users are teenagers. And for a long time he was unaware of his growing fame, explains Chris Stokel-Walker. The video summed up the exasperation many elderly members of society have felt. Joe Allington, from Lichfield, walked the aisles of his local supermarket, eyes agog at the empty shelves he saw before him. He returned home downcast, with no shopping. This was before the government introduced strict social distancing rules and Allington began self-isolating. He didn't really need to go shopping as he's been living with his daughter and her family for the last four-and-a-half years, but the 14-second-long performance hit a nerve and has now been viewed more than 42 million times on the shortform video sharing app, TikTok. This is Allington's biggest success since he started posting on TikTok three months ago as Poppa Joe. To his surprise, he's picked up 1.5 million followers on a platform generally regarded as the preserve of teenagers. I don't think old people generally look at TikTok very much, admits Allington. It's all youngsters - seven and-eight-year-olds. Like many older people encountering smartphone apps for the first time, he has his granddaughter to thank. Allington's youngest granddaughter, Brooke Paintain, 15 - an active TikToker with more than 65,000 followers - first uploaded videos during the 2018 Christmas holidays, months after the app merged with lipsyncing platform Musical.ly. She was doing all these weird dances that kids do on TikTok, and trying to get me lipsyncing, says Allington. He wasn't interested at that point. It was only in January this year that he was finally persuaded to dance in a video. Allington also featured in one of Brooke's videos on 23 January. As she danced around him she directed her followers to his TikTok profile, asking them to get him up to 10,000 followers. Within three weeks, he had more than 30,000. I just don't know why I'm popular, he explains. I've never been popular like that in my life. A petrol tanker driver for decades, after leaving school at the age of 14 in the late 1940s, Allington progressed to work in transport management. He retired at the age of 65, and became the family clown to his daughter, Wendy Paintain, 54, and his granddaughters. When they suggested he join TikTok, it was a natural fit. I've found my second childhood, you know, he says. He combines high drama and sadness with a quirky side, making light of serious situations. In one video, he dances to classic song Oops in front of a green-screened image of him lying in bed after a massive heart attack in 2019. Another running theme of videos is his obsession with donuts - banned from his diet after his heart attack - and his attempts to eat them. There are also occasional references to the pain of losing his wife, who died in 2009. Allington claims he has little-to-no involvement in the videos he posts. Wendy coerced me into doing little bits of acting for the videos, which I did, and it's taken off from there, he says. I quite enjoy being made up, dressed up, and made a fool of. Wendy says: 'Dad, we're doing TikTok, we're doing this today.' Then I just do as I'm told. I'm very obedient, you know. He'll have a go at anything except dance challenges, one of the key currencies of TikTok virality. I'm not into waving my arms like that, he explains. I can't do it! Because of his hands-off approach, Allington had no idea he was becoming an internet celebrity, so he was startled when Wendy told him he had more than one million followers. It's really astounding to think there are so many people who know me as an old fool, he says. None of his friends know about his success, either. Until he was forced to self-isolate with his family, Allington went out for meals with them two or three times a week, and would take part in a local karaoke club every Saturday night. But they don't belong to the TikTok generation. Allington isn't the only superannuated TikToker, though. There's Grandad Frank, for example, a fleet-footed dancer who has more than 780,000 followers; and Granny Gone Wild, an American grandmother who combines comedy videos with speaking about being a survivor of domestic violence. Young TikTok users have a soft spot for grandparents, says Timothy Armoo of Fanbytes, an influencer marketing agency that manages TikTok stars. On TikTok, if you did something with your parents, people might think that's a bit cringe, he says. But if you did it with your grandparent, it's so incredible that your grandparent would know how to use TikTok, that it becomes quite cool. Now that he has got to know the app better, Allington is using it to connect with people he isn't seeing during isolation, the nine-year-old daughter of the barman at his local club, for example, and his elder granddaughter, Sasha. But he also uses FaceTime and Houseparty and so on, he says. Many of Allington's recent videos have been making light of the coronavirus-enforced quarantine. One, seen 457,000 times, saw him don Marigold washing-up gloves, multiple bin bags and a mask covering only his nose for his government-mandated daily walk. It feeds well into the whole coronavirus situation we find ourselves in, Armoo says. Right now, people are checking up on their grandparents and quite a lot of video content is going out with people taking care of their grandparents. Grandad Joe is pretty much the perfect embodiment of it."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-52228423,Why does President Trump want to mine on the Moon?,"President Trump wants the United States to start mining on the Moon for minerals. The US president recently signed an executive order stating America has the right to explore and use resources from outer space. The order also said the US did not see space as a common area for resources, and didn't need permission of international agreements to get started. But why does he want to mine in space? And what are the benefits? Radio 1 Newsbeat has been speaking to a couple of experts who can fill us in. According to Sarah Cruddas, mining the Moon will help humans travel further in space, to places like Mars. Sarah's a space journalist and says the Moon can become an intergalactic petrol station - because it has the resources needed for rocket fuel - like hydrogen and oxygen. Having a petrol station in space means rockets can travel further into space before worrying about running out of fuel. It's like not taking a kitchen sink when you go on holiday. We shouldn't need to take everything with us when we go into space, Sarah tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. Exploring deeper is important because space has lots of resources which can be used to benefit our planet. Professor Benjamin Sovacool says the world is moving towards renewable energy sources because of climate change and needs those resources. We are currently depleting the resources we have, Benjamin tells Newsbeat. Benjamin is professor of energy policy at University of Sussex and says mining more materials in space can help build items such as electric cars - which will be good for the environment in the long-term. Metals such as lithium or cobalt - which you need - are mainly in places like China, Russia or Congo. And it's difficult to get them. He says it can be complicated trying to source materials from different suppliers around the world, all of which have different rules. Mining on the Moon, with one entity, might be easier, he adds. Sarah says mining those materials on Earth in places like Congo, is done in horrible conditions. But Benjamin does warn that in space mining doesn't offer a short-term fix for climate change on earth. One of the reasons behind President Trump's decision to mine on the Moon could be a lack of access to minerals for the US compared with other parts of the world. The US has lost the race - other countries are ahead, like China and Russia, says Benjamin. Materials mined by China have been made available around the world. It will be really attractive to people like President Trump if you are able to get minerals in a place where the Chinese aren't - like space. There has been tension between the US and China since President Trump came to power, and Benjamin says this is a chance for him to assert dominance and leadership. President Trump's order is clear that international law won't apply to US efforts in space - but laws about what humans can do off-planet are less well defined. Space law is developing, it's something that will change over time, Sarah says. No country can claim to own the Moon, but currently it's like maritime law: If you go there, find it and mine it - it's yours to keep. Benjamin says setting our sights on outer space may be inevitable because of climate change happening here on our planet. One of the arguments people make is space is the only place left to go because we'll eventually mess up our Earth so much, he says. That viewpoint demands space exploration as the only viable alternative for the future of humanity. According to Sarah, the technology is there and progress is fast because there are more private companies involved. Before, it was always government funded. But with private companies and individuals, there's more money and ambition, she tells Newsbeat. We're going to see huge advances on things like mining on the Moon, mining asteroids and the sea, and humans visiting Mars. That's all feasible within our lifetime. But Benjamin says it's also important to use technological developments on existing mining processes on Earth. Lunar mining is at the top of the pyramid, it's really hard to reach, he says. So first develop existing mines, such as gas and deep-water mining. After that, you can go to the next level up. He feels lunar mining is at least 10 to 15 years away, and its future will even then be very dependent on other factors such as money and resource. Ultimately, though, Sarah says it's all a part of something greater. You look up at the Moon, we're watching the sky. It's all part of being involved in extending humanity beyond Earth.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-suffolk-52124715,"Newmarket schoolgirl, 11, starts 'blue heart' campaign for NHS","An 11-year-old girl has begun a campaign to show the NHS how proud we are by displaying blue hearts in windows. Tamara McAuley, from Newmarket, in Suffolk, loves art and designed the hearts in the health service's colour. Her mother set up a Facebook group and it took off from there with the page now close to having 3,000 followers. Tamara hopes more children will make the hearts to show the NHS we are all supporting them. One of her family friends works as a nurse at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge and sees the blue heart in Tamara's window each time she travels to work. As Tamara is not old enough to have a Facebook account her mother, Caroline Hutchinson, set up a page on the social media website called Blue Hearts for NHS. The page now has followers from as far away as Australia and the United States. Miss Hutchinson said they also have a lot of nurses and NHS staff commenting on the page as well, saying where they are from and what they do, so I'm really pleased. Miss Hutchinson said the hearts were to acknowledge how hard NHS staff are working for everybody and how proud the British nation are of them during the coronavirus outbreak. It's for when the NHS staff are going to work they can look up at these windows and just see something to make them smile, she said. Tamara added: I am hoping more children will make the hearts to show the NHS how proud we are and that we are all supporting them. Thank you NHS. People around the UK have taken part in weekly Clap For Our Carers tributes, saluting NHS and care workers."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52199185,Coronavirus: What's happening to the beer left in pubs?,"Pubs, like other public venues, look set to stay shut for the foreseeable future. But what's going to happen to the contents of their cellars? Fifty million pints - give or take. That's the amount of beer expected to go unused in barrels if pubs remain closed into the summer because of coronavirus. Publicans are currently unable to sell their lagers, ales and ciders - save for takeaways and home deliveries. It's a very sad waste of all the work and talent that goes into producing great beer, says Tom Stainer, chief executive of the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra). People won't get to drink it and all those resources have been used up for nothing. Mr Stainer estimates the UK's 39,000 pubs have, on average, 15 barrels in their cellar at any given time. Most are kegs containing 11 gallons (88 pints) each - although many real ales come in nine-gallon (72-pint) casks. The best-before dates on pasteurised beer - including most lagers - are usually three to four months after delivery. Those for real ales and other unpasteurised beer are usually set at six to nine weeks. So most stock could go to waste if social distancing measures remain in place for several months. Keris De Villiers, landlady of the Ram Inn, the Old Sergeant and the Pig and Whistle in Wandsworth, south-west London, says barrelled beer worth about £10,000 could go off in her cellars - while 1,000 litres (1,760 pints) more beer remains in vats at the SlyBeast microbrewery she and husband Lee have recently set up. We could do takeaways, she says, but that would mean selling beer on the corner of a very small pavement. That wouldn't be socially responsible, with the need for people to keep their distance from one another. The whole situation is heart-breaking. Our brewer literally talks to his tanks when he's at work every day. People really care about the beer they're making. It's a craft and people are passionate about it. Supermarket alcohol sales increased by more than a fifth last month as pubs - along with cafes and restaurants - closed on 20 March. People are missing these things in their lives, says Mr Stainer. It's not the biggest issue that the country is dealing with, but aspects of life like going to the cinema or cafe, or going for a pint, are something we treasure. Many breweries and distributors have offered to take back barrels at no charge once the lockdown is over, taking some of the financial pressure off landlords. Iain Crockett, director of Gloucestershire-based Severn Brewing, says draymen - people who deliver beer - face the worst week of their lives when the pub trade returns, having to lift full barrels - rather than empties - out of cellars. He wants there to be at least a couple of weeks' notice before pubs are allowed to reopen. All the little brewers are going to be completely shafted otherwise, Mr Crockett says. While the big brewers have large storage capacities, small operators will be starting more from scratch, he adds. Before that, though, there's the question of how to get rid of tens of millions of pints. Can we expect scenes like those following the introduction of Prohibition in the US a century ago, where bottles and barrels were smashed, their contents poured away? Probably not. In the US, bar owners have been told not to tip out-of-date beer down storm drains, because it's illegal and environmentally damaging. Some UK publicans, have, however, already resorted to this. The British Institute of Innkeeping is advising against such action, amid concern it could leave landlords further out of pocket. Under Treasury rules, when publicans get rid of large amounts of spoilt beer, duty doesn't need to be paid on it. Brewery representatives normally oversee this process, but because of social distancing they can't visit premises at the moment. The government has temporarily allowed brewers to appoint publicans to oversee the dumping of beer. But they must keep a proper record of it, including perhaps filming a video as proof it's been destroyed, rather than put aside for profit. One option that publicans and brewers who spoke to the BBC would love to try is converting out-of-date beer into hand sanitiser, by extracting the alcohol. Independent brewer Brewdog is already making hand sanitiser at its Aberdeenshire premises, while the government is giving manufacturers who want to do the same priority access to the methylated spirits - or denatured alcohol - they need. Despite these difficult times, Mrs De Villiers says pub owners and tenants are doing all we can to survive and assist the community. The breweries are helping us and they want us to survive, she adds. Everyone's ready to help everyone else. In an effort to limit the economic damage caused by coronavirus, the government has offered £330bn in loans, £20bn in other aid, a business rates holiday, and grants for retailers and pubs. Pubs are at the heart of our communities and an important part of local economies, says a spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. We've asked them to temporarily close in order to help protect people and reduce the spread of the virus. But we are also delivering support to help businesses, including pubs, through the coronavirus pandemic."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52268341,Coronavirus: New Zealand nurse who treated Boris Johnson says it was 'surreal',"A New Zealand nurse praised by Boris Johnson for helping to save his life said treating the prime minister was the most surreal time in her life, her parents have said. Jenny McGee, along with Luis Pitarma from Portugal, was praised by the PM for standing at his bedside when things could have gone either way. Ms McGee's parents told Television New Zealand they are exceptionally proud. They said she treated Mr Johnson like any other patient. Mr Johnson was discharged from St Thomas' Hospital in London on Sunday, one week after being admitted to be treated for coronavirus. He spent several nights in the intensive care unit where he was given oxygen. He said the NHS has saved my life, no question and paid tribute to many medics, singling out Ms McGee and Mr Pitarma specifically. Ms McGee's parents said they knew Mr Johnson was in the hospital their daughter works in as it was all over the news. But our daughter's very professional so we don't ask things or she doesn't spill things. It really wasn't until he was out of intensive care until she actually told us, her mother Caroline told TVNZ. She said she had just had a most surreal time in her life, something she will never forget. And that she had been taking care of Boris. She added: It makes us feel exceptionally proud, obviously. But she has told us these things over the years and it doesn't matter what patient she's looking after, this is what she does and I just find it incredible that she, any nurses, can do this for 12 hours. Sit and watch a patient, and twiddle away with all the different knobs to keep their patients alive. It's absolutely amazing. Her brother Rob said that when he spoke to her she was on her way to work to do another night shift. He told the New Zealand Herald: We are all very proud of Jen, not just in the support she gave Boris - but what she has been doing helping everyday people. Whilst she is blown away by Boris's recognition, she is just really pleased to see the public recognition for the amazing work the NHS is doing - that made her really proud. Ms McGee is from Invercargill, on New Zealand's South Island. The mayor of the city Sir Tim Shadbolt told Stuff.co.nz: It's not very often a nurse from Invercargill saves the life of the British prime minister. Meanwhile, her former school Verdon College paid tribute to her courage, adding she had wanted to be a nurse since leaving school in 2002. Jenny is described by her past teachers as an absolutely delightful person and someone who had a caring and humble nature, the college said in a statement. The second nurse mentioned by Mr Johnson has been named as Luis Pitarma. According to the Expresso, Mr Pitarma, 29, is from Aveiro in Portugal and moved to London six years ago. He studied nursing in Lisbon. It added that he first worked at the Luton and Dunstable University Hospital for two years before moving to St Thomas'. The president of Portugal, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, has personally thanked Mr Pitarma, as well as the commitment of all Portuguese health professionals who in Portugal and around the world are providing decisive help in the fight to the pandemic. On Monday, No 10 confirmed Mr Johnson had left hospital after being given the all clear by medics. He will continue recovering at Chequers, the prime minister's official country residence, as it was considered to be a suitable place and he will not be carrying out government work, the spokesman said. Aides are reportedly expecting Mr Johnson to be out of action for up to a month while he recovers. Mr Johnson spoke to Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab - who is currently in charge of running the government - over the weekend, No 10 added. Speaking in a video posted after he left hospital, Mr Johnson, 55, said it was hard to find words to express my debt to the health service. He thanked many nurses by name before adding: I hope they won't mind if I mention in particular two nurses who stood by my bedside for 48 hours when things could have gone either way. They're Jenny from New Zealand. And Luis from Portugal near Porto. The reason in the end my body did start to get enough oxygen was because for every second of the night they were watching and they were thinking and they were caring and making the interventions I needed. Around one in eight NHS workers - 13.1% of the workforce, or 153,000 staff - are not British, according to a parliamentary report published in July last year. After British, the most common nationalities of NHS staff are Indian with around 21,000 workers, followed by Filipino, Irish, Polish and then Portuguese staff. On Sunday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock paid tribute to everyone who has joined the NHS from all over the world."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52229828,Coronavirus: Six ways the lockdown has changed the UK,"Life in the UK has been utterly transformed in the three weeks since restrictions were brought in to curb the spread of coronavirus. On Monday 23 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said all non-essential travel and public gatherings had to stop, with people urged to leave home only for exercise, to shop for essential items, for medical care, or when their work could not be done at home. All shops selling non-essential items closed. Pubs, restaurants, theatres, cinemas and places of worship have all also shut. These restrictions have affected all aspects of society. The lockdown's aim has been to limit the spread of coronavirus across the country, to help the NHS to cope and ultimately reduce the number of deaths from the disease. Since the lockdown started on 23 March, the number of people who have tested positive for coronavirus has gone from 6,650 to more than 80,000. But the government's advisers have said there is evidence that the public's adherence to the measures is starting to have an impact. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, said: It's not taking off in that sharp uptake, it's not gone sky high. And if anything there might even be some flattening. That is because of what we're all doing with social distancing. People are also adapting to how they use the health service. In March, the number of people attending A&E dropped whilst the numbers of calls made to 111 - the NHS's hotline - reached record highs. The public's use of transport has fallen dramatically over the past few weeks, although this trend started before the lockdown measures were announced by the prime minister, as many people started to work from home. Overall transport use - across road, rail and the Tube in London - fell by 60% between early February and the beginning of April, the Department for Transport says. Footfall at major railway stations across the country has also fallen significantly since the lockdown was introduced, data from Network Rail suggests. For example, in the week before the measures were brought in, footfall at Birmingham New Street station stood at over half a million. But that had fallen by 86% at the start of April to just 71,230. It's a similar trend for London and Manchester. Meanwhile, trips to parks and beaches on 5 April, the second Sunday of lockdown, were 29% lower than normal according to Google analytics data. But the previous Sunday they were 52% lower than normal, suggesting trips were creeping back up with the warmer weather. Air pollution levels in the UK have dropped significantly in the weeks since the country went into lockdown. The nitrogen dioxide (NO2) level has fallen across the UK, with the daily average down almost 40% on the same period last year. NO2, released from car exhausts, is a serious air pollutant. Some cities have seen levels fall by more than 60%, including Brighton and Portsmouth, according to BBC analysis of Defra statistics. Daily readings from air quality monitoring stations were compared with the same period last year. About 723,000 people have applied for universal credit since the lockdown began. Of these, 473,000 applied in the first eight days, almost as many as applied during the whole of the preceding three weeks, and almost 10 times as many as would apply in an average week. A further 250,000 people signed up during the second week of lockdown according to the Department for Work and Pensions. Universal credit is a consolidated monthly payment for those of working-age, which replaced a host of previous benefits including income-based jobseeker's allowance, housing benefit, child tax credit and working tax credit. While furlough payments are available to help the self-employed and those who cannot do their jobs during the pandemic, some groups - such as those who have recently became a freelancer, moved jobs or been made redundant before the cut-off date are not eligible. This has helped prompt an increase in universal credit claims. While there is still considerable pressure on the benefits system, the figures show that the number of claims is now starting to come down, having peaked in the first week of lockdown. In the week before the restrictions started, supermarket sales were 44% higher than the same time last year, as many rushed to stock up amid fear of shortages. But average sales fell by 7.5% over the first fortnight of lockdown according to consultancy Neilsen. When the country was told not to travel people stopped shopping, says Mike Watkins, Nielsen's head of retailer and business insight. They had already bought a lot of stuff, and their larders and freezers were full. While more people tried to shop online, as 93% of purchases are normally made in-store, supermarkets have struggled to cope with the extra demand, he adds. Supermarket sales of non-food products such as clothes slumped 45%, and impulse buys have dipped. The enthusiasm of shoppers to buy nice food will be muted, as people want to limit travel and time spent in stores, Mr Watkins says. The National Domestic Abuse helpline has seen a 25% increase in calls since the lockdown, the charity Refuge says. It is now receiving hundreds of extra calls for help every week. Isolation can make pre-existing abusive behaviour worse, but isn't the reason for it, says Refuge, which runs the helpline. The increase echoes findings from around the world, including a 32% surge in reported domestic violence cases in France, and a 12% increase to Spain's gender violence hotline since lockdowns began in those countries. However, overall crime reported to police in England and Wales has dropped by around 20% in recent weeks. New police powers for fining those who breach the lockdown rules are being used - in the first two weeks, 1,084 fines were issued.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52133054,Coronavirus: When will we know if the UK lockdown is working?,"It's two weeks since Boris Johnson announced the UK's lockdown, and there are signs the rate of infection is starting to slow, though not deaths. While the number of people dying in hospital with coronavirus is doubling every few days, the figures for confirmed cases and hospitalisations are slowing down. The daily death total will follow suit, scientists say. But they warn we could still see record highs in the coming days. Over the past three weeks, the number of new deaths reported has been doubling every three-and-a-half days. The graph below shows this, with the daily numbers as red bars, against a straight black line which represents that constant, regular rate of doubling. Not every day's figures are exactly on trend. There have been dips on Mondays (for example 23 and 30 March) when the weekend's figures were being reported, with sharp rises in the following days. In terms of numbers, what matters is the overall trend, rather than the day-to-day figures, says James Gill, a lecturer at Warwick Medical School. That trend is a worrying one: if it continued, we would expect to see more than 1,000 deaths a day very soon and 2,000 a day later this week. Even if all infections had stopped the day after lockdown, we would still be seeing new deaths reported a month later. It takes time for an infection to develop into symptoms or a life-threatening illness, and it takes time for them to be treated, even if that treatment eventually ends in death. And after that, deaths have to be recorded and reported, a process that can take more days, and weeks in some cases. That reporting delay means that, when we do pass the peak, we may not see it in the death figures for a few days. Social distancing was introduced before the lockdown, so there is some hope that the effect of those measures may start to show in the coming weeks. Modellers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine estimate that for every four people we met or touched before lockdown, we are only meeting one now. They calculated this could reduce the ability of the virus to reproduce by 75%. But while the lockdown measures are not yet showing up in the death data, other figures do give clues to their effectiveness. Since last weekend, the daily growth in new cases has fallen away from the long-term trend. In the middle of the week, new cases did start growing again but at a slower pace than before. The number of new cases could rise again this week, says Prof Keith Neal, an epidemiologist at the University of Nottingham. But that could be because of more testing as opposed to an increase in infection rates. Until the end of March, testing was largely limited to patients in hospital. As the government tests more and more NHS staff, we should expect to see more confirmed cases. Prof Neal says we'll only get a clear picture of what's happening if the government report the number of new confirmed cases in NHS workers separately from cases in patients. The number of patients in hospital in England with coronavirus has also been growing more slowly than before, in the past week. These figures for England mask regional variation: the number of people in hospital with Covid-19 in London has started to plateau, but has been growing in the Midlands and the North West in recent days.

China implemented severe lockdowns in Wuhan and Hubei province late in January before it saw 30 deaths. The number of deaths reported each day continued to increase for nearly three weeks but has fallen since then. Italy's national lockdown began on 8 March. About two weeks after that, the number of deaths started to plateau, with the most recent figures showing a fall. Like the UK, Italy took measures to stop the spread of the epidemic, such as early, targeted versions in northern Italian towns in late February, before the nationwide lockdown. It is possible that these measures could have started to flatten the curve of deaths before the effects of the wider lockdown were visible. The trends in numbers of deaths from China and Italy are evidence that efforts to stop the spread of the virus can slow, and eventually reverse, the growth in the number of deaths. While it takes a long time for a reduction in infections to feed through into a reduction in deaths, the numbers of confirmed cases are already levelling off and the growth in confirmed cases has slowed down."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52121376,Coronavirus: Will summer make a difference?,"The idea warmer weather might stop the coronavirus seems to have faded as the virus has spread around the globe. But could new research contain a glimmer of hope? It's too early to know for sure whether the new coronavirus is seasonal. To really know that, we'd have to watch how cases change in one place across the year. But we can look at its spread in different climates across the world for clues. There is some evidence coronavirus cases have particularly clustered around cooler, dryer regions. One study indicated countries particularly affected by the virus - those where it was spreading undetected via community transmission - by 10 March had lower average temperatures than those with fewer cases. Another paper looked at 100 Chinese cities with more than 40 cases of Covid-19 and suggested the higher the temperature and humidity, the lower the rate of transmission. And another, not yet peer-reviewed, study suggested that although cases of the new coronavirus could be found all over the world, outbreaks had particularly clustered in relatively cool and dry areas - at least until 23 March. But, as a group of researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine pointed out, the virus has now spread to every World Health Organization region, effectively spanning all climatic zones, from cold and dry to hot and humid regions. With lots of other viruses, including flu, a seasonal pattern is seen in the northern and southern hemispheres. But tropical regions close to the equator don't experience the same pattern. And some of the hot and humid regions that have seen locally transmitted cases of the Covid-19 virus, such as Malaysia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, are close to the equator and so might not provide the best evidence for what will happen elsewhere. But looking to the southern hemisphere, Australia and New Zealand - at the tail-end of their summer season when their first cases were seen - have had far fewer cases than many of their northern-hemisphere counterparts. There are lots of other factors at play, such as global footfall and the density of the population. And since the virus has gradually spread around the world - initially through global travel - at the same time as seasons have been changing, it's difficult to pinpoint the effect of climate specifically. There is some evidence other coronaviruses mainly circulate in the winter months, according to a team of researchers from University College London (UCL) and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. They asked almost 2,000 people for a weekly report on whether anyone in their household had symptoms of respiratory illness. And anyone with symptoms was asked to send in a swab for testing for a range of viruses. From this, the researchers observed large peaks in coronavirus cases in the winter, around the same time as flu season. There were a small number of cases in the summer. One of the study's authors, Ellen Fragaszy, at UCL said it was therefore possible we will see a bit of a relief in cases over the summer. But we could not be sure this is how the new coronavirus would behave. And the large number of cases and their spread across the world suggested we shouldn't be too hopeful of a summer respite. The new coronavirus, called Sars-Cov-2, which causes the Covid-19 disease, appears to spread in basically the same way as other coronaviruses. But what makes it distinct is the how ill it makes you and the number of deaths it causes. Dr Michael Head, at the University of Southampton, said the development and impact of the novel coronavirus was clearly very different from the existing 'common cold' type coronaviruses. It remains to be seen as to whether Covid-19 cases will decline in response to environmental changes such as temperature and humidity, he said. Follow Rachel on Twitter"
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/51980731,Coronavirus and chloroquine: Is there evidence it works?,"There has been a global surge in demand for drugs normally used against malaria to tackle the coronavirus, as governments urgently seek out treatments for the new disease. Chloroquine, and a related derivative, hydroxychloroquine, have gained attention - despite the World Health Organization (WHO) saying there is no definitive evidence they work. So what is the current evidence of their effectiveness as a treatment for the coronavirus, and who is using them? President Trump has frequently referred to the potential of hydroxychloroquine in White House briefings. At a recent press conference, he referred to it and said: What do you have to lose? Take it. In a video removed by Facebook for breaching its misinformation guidelines, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro claimed hydroxychloroquine is working in all places. Tablets containing chloroquine have long been used in the treatment of malaria to reduce fever and inflammation, and the hope is that they can also inhibit the virus that causes Covid-19. Chloroquine seems to block the coronavirus in lab studies. There's some anecdotal evidence from doctors saying it has appeared to help, says James Gallagher, BBC health correspondent. There is insufficient evidence at the moment from current trials as to their effective use in treatment of patients with Covid-19. There are also risks of serious side effects, including renal and liver damage. We need larger, high-quality randomised clinical trials in order to better evaluate their effectiveness, says University of Oxford 's Kome Gbinigie, author of a report on anti-malarial testing for Covid-19. More than 20 trials are being carried out, including in the US, UK, Spain and China. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove says the UK is conducting rapid clinical trials on anti-malarials to assess if they are able to reduce the impact of Covid-19 on those affected. In the US, various trials are under way for a combination of drugs including chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and an antibiotic called azithromycin, for treating Covid-19 patients. The US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA), the body in charge of licensing medicines in America, has granted emergency use authorisation for these drugs in the treatment of Covid-19 for a limited number of hospitalised cases. That does not mean the FDA is saying they definitely work. But it does mean that in specific circumstances, hospitals can request and use the medicines from government stockpiles for use in Covid-19 treatment. The US government has said that 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine have been donated to the national stockpile by a German-based pharmaceutical company. Other countries are also deploying these anti-malarial drugs to varying degrees. France has authorised doctors to prescribe them for patients with Covid-19, but the country's medical watchdog has warned of side effects. India's health ministry has recommended the use of hydroxychloroquine as a preventative treatment for healthcare workers, as well as households in contact with confirmed cases if they have a prescription from a doctor. However, India's government research body has warned against the unrestricted usage of the anti-malarial drug and said it was experimental and only for emergency situations. Several Middle Eastern countries have authorised its use or are conducting trials. This includes Bahrain (which claims it was one of the first countries to use hydroxychloroquine on coronavirus patients), Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. As interest in these drugs has grown as a potential treatment for Covid-19, many countries have seen high demand and shortages. Chloroquine and its derivatives have long been widely available in pharmacies, particularly in developing countries, for the treatment of malaria. This is despite their declining efficacy against malaria, as the disease has become increasingly resistant. Jordan has banned the sale of hydroxychloroquine in pharmacies to prevent stockpiling. Similarly, the Kuwaiti Health Ministry decided to withdraw all medicines containing the drugs from private pharmacies and limit them to hospitals and health centres. Kenya has banned over-the-counter sales of chloroquine, so it is now only available on prescription. India is a major producer of these antimalarial drugs, and has imposed a ban on exports. President Trump has made a personal plea to India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, for access to the drugs for use in the United States. It has been reported that India is considering this request. In Nigeria, households still regularly use tablets containing chloroquine for treating malaria, even though it was banned in 2005 for first-line use because of its declining effectiveness. News of a February study in China about the use of chloroquine for the coronavirus had already sparked lively debate in Lagos, so people began stocking up. Following Mr Trump's reference to it as a coronavirus treatment, this ramped up, and shops and chemists sold out of the drug very quickly. But the Nigerian Centres for Disease Control has told people to stop taking it. The WHO has NOT approved the use of chloroquine for #COVID19 management. Officials in Lagos state say there have been a number of people poisoned from overdoses of chloroquine. Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter"
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52197594,Coronavirus: What is the risk to men over 50?,"Most people with coronavirus will recover within about a week of getting symptoms and will not need medical care. But some people will need to be treated in hospital - as the prime minister was. Boris Johnson, who is 55, has been discharged from St Thomas' hospital in London after being in intensive care. He was given oxygen, but didn't need a ventilator machine to help his breathing. Some people are at higher risk of complications. This includes people over the age of 70, regardless of whether they have a medical condition or not, and people of any age with underlying health conditions such as heart disease. There are more than 1.5 million people in the UK who are at the greatest risk of needing hospital treatment if they catch coronavirus. This includes people with cancer who have been receiving chemotherapy, and they are being asked to stay at home all of the time to shield themselves from the virus. Coronavirus also appears to disproportionately affect men in their 50s and 60s to a certain degree, although they are not singled out as a high risk group. But it's not that clear-cut. Correlation isn't necessarily cause. Scientists are unsure. UK data from intensive care hospital wards shows the average patient who is critically ill is aged 60. Most are men and many have other health conditions that could put them at increased risk, such as heart problems and obesity. Of the 647 coronavirus-related deaths registered by the Office for National Statistics in England and Wales up to the week ending 27th March, 44 were aged 45-65 - around 7% of the total. Death rates go up with age in both men and women, but men tend to outstrip women across the ages. Data from China, where the pandemic began, also suggests men are at greater risk than women, although experts caution there could be factors other than gender, such as smoking habits, that could explain the link. Prof Ian Hall, Professor of Molecular Medicine, University of Nottingham, said: I am not convinced this completely explains the increased risk of severe disease in men, so it seems possible there may be some other as yet unidentified factor playing a role. Men are more likely than women to have heart disease, diabetes and chronic lung disease. Some have suggested genes and sex hormones might be involved too. Prof Philip Goulder, an expert in immunology at University of Oxford, said: It is becoming increasingly recognised that there are substantial differences in the immune system between males and females and that these have significant impact on outcome from a wide range of infectious diseases. The immune response throughout life to vaccines and infections is typically more aggressive and more effective in females compared to males. This could be down to women carrying two copies of the X chromosome, compared to the single X and a Y that men have. A number of critical immune genes are located on the X chromosome, he says. Every year, about 600,000 people in the UK die. People with underlying health conditions and the elderly are most at risk, just as they are if they have coronavirus. Nearly 10% of people aged over 80 will die in the next year, Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, at the University of Cambridge, points out, and the risk of them dying if infected with coronavirus is almost exactly the same. Stay as fit and healthy as you can by exercising and eating a balanced diet. If you smoke, now is a good time to quit. Men are more likely than women to: Coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can be breathed in, or cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on, then your eyes, nose or mouth. So, coughing and sneezing into tissues, not touching your face with unwashed hands, and avoiding close contact with infected people are important. If you have a new, continuous cough or a fever you should stay at home and self-isolate for at least seven days. If you, or someone you live with, develop symptoms, the entire household needs to isolate for 14 days to monitor for signs of the disease. The main reason people need hospital treatment is difficulty breathing. In the UK, the NHS 111 website will guide you through what you need to do. If you are so breathless that you are unable to speak more than a few words then you will be told to call 999 as this is a medical emergency. If you become so ill that you've stopped doing all of your usual daily activities then the website will advise speaking to a nurse by dialling NHS 111."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-suffolk-52214965,Coronavirus: Rainbow trail success surprises Ipswich mum,"A mum credited with popularising the trend of creating rainbows during lockdown has said she is amazed it has become a global phenomenon. Crystal Stanley, of Ipswich, said she set up the Rainbow Trail Facebook page after seeing something similar on social media from Italy. More than 182,000 members from around the world have since joined her group. Miss Stanley, 31, said the rainbows were a sign of positivity, hope and togetherness during the crisis. The mother-of-one said she painted her first rainbow on an old piece of wallpaper. She said she thought it would be a bit of fun to encourage others to create them for their windows. About 4,000 joined the Facebook group within two days and it had just got bigger and bigger since, she said. Miss Stanley said the group had members from across the country and around the world, including Thailand, the United States and Australia. It's literally been unbelievable how far it's gone, she said. The creativity shown by people was fantastic, she said, adding that she had been sent images of rainbows made from pine cones and toys. She said she got thousands of posts on the Facebook page a day and the Rainbow Trail had set up a fundraising page to help East Anglia's Children's Hospices (EACH). Miss Stanley, who has a daughter Ariana Batchelor, three, said: Seeing the rainbows makes me think of the children or adults who have created them and what they are all going through during these hard times. And they have created these to show support for all the key workers and to make them smile when they see them. On Sunday, the Queen said the rainbows would be the symbol of the UK's national spirit in the face of the pandemic. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51214864,Coronavirus: What it does to the body,"The coronavirus emerged in only December last year, but already the world is dealing with a pandemic of the virus and the disease it causes - Covid-19. For most, the disease is mild, but some people die. So how is the virus attacking the body, why are some people being killed and how is it treated? This is when the virus is establishing itself. Viruses work by getting inside the cells your body is made of and then hijacking them. The coronavirus, officially called Sars-CoV-2, can invade your body when you breathe it in (after someone coughs nearby) or you touch a contaminated surface and then your face. It first infects the cells lining your throat, airways and lungs and turns them into coronavirus factories that spew out huge numbers of new viruses that go on to infect yet more cells. At this early stage, you will not be sick and some people may never develop symptoms. The incubation period, the time between infection and first symptoms appearing, varies widely, but is five days on average. This is all most people will experience. Covid-19 is a mild infection for eight out of 10 people who get it and the core symptoms are a fever and a cough. Body aches, sore throat and a headache are all possible, but not guaranteed. The fever, and generally feeling grotty, is a result of your immune system responding to the infection. It has recognised the virus as a hostile invader and signals to the rest of the body something is wrong by releasing chemicals called cytokines. These rally the immune system, but also cause the body aches, pain and fever. The coronavirus cough is initially a dry one (you're not bringing stuff up) and this is probably down to irritation of cells as they become infected by the virus. Some people will eventually start coughing up sputum - a thick mucus containing dead lung cells killed by the virus. These symptoms are treated with bed rest, plenty of fluids and paracetamol. You won't need specialist hospital care. This stage lasts about a week - at which point most recover because their immune system has fought off the virus. However, some will develop a more serious form of Covid-19. This is the best we understand at the moment about this stage, however, there are studies emerging that suggest the disease can cause more cold-like symptoms such as a runny nose too. If the disease progresses it will be due to the immune system overreacting to the virus. Those chemical signals to the rest of the body cause inflammation, but this needs to be delicately balanced. Too much inflammation can cause collateral damage throughout the body. The virus is triggering an imbalance in the immune response, there's too much inflammation, how it is doing this we don't know, said Dr Nathalie MacDermott, from King's College London. Inflammation of the lungs is called pneumonia. If it was possible to travel through your mouth down the windpipe and through the tiny tubes in your lungs, you'd eventually end up in tiny little air sacs. This is where oxygen moves into the blood and carbon dioxide moves out, but in pneumonia the tiny sacs start to fill with water and can eventually cause shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. Some people will need a ventilator to help them breathe. This stage is thought to affect around 14% of people, based on data from China. It is estimated around 6% of cases become critically ill. By this point the body is starting to fail and there is a real chance of death. The problem is the immune system is now spiralling out of control and causing damage throughout the body. It can lead to septic shock when the blood pressure drops to dangerously low levels and organs stop working properly or fail completely. Acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by widespread inflammation in the lungs stops the body getting enough oxygen it needs to survive. It can stop the kidneys from cleaning the blood and damage the lining of your intestines. The virus sets up such a huge degree of inflammation that you succumb... it becomes multi-organ failure, Dr Bharat Pankhania said. And if the immune system cannot get on top of the virus, then it will eventually spread to every corner of the body where it can cause even more damage. Treatment by this stage will be highly invasive and can include ECMO or extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation. This is essentially an artificial lung that takes blood out of the body through thick tubes, oxygenates it and pumps it back in. But eventually the damage can reach fatal levels at which organs can no longer keep the body alive. Doctors have described how some patients died despite their best efforts. The first two patients to die at Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, China, detailed in the Lancet Medical journal, were seemingly healthy, although they were long-term smokers and that would have weakened their lungs. The first, a 61-year-old man, had severe pneumonia by the time he arrived at hospital. He was in acute respiratory distress, and despite being put on a ventilator, his lungs failed and his heart stopped beating. He died 11 days after he was admitted. The second patient, a 69-year-old man, also had acute respiratory distress syndrome. He was attached to an ECMO machine but this wasn't enough. He died of severe pneumonia and septic shock when his blood pressure collapsed. Follow James on Twitter."

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-52103747,Coronavirus: The world in lockdown in maps and charts,"Coronavirus has now infected more than one million people worldwide, but its impact extends far beyond just those who have had it. Even the frequency of use of the word unprecedented is unprecedented at the moment. According to Google Trends it's been used three times more over the last two weeks than the highest point recorded previously. As governments around the world have enacted new measures and given official advice, we take a look at the impact that it's had on people and the world around them. The approaches to dealing with coronavirus across the world have been wide-ranging to say the least. In Colombia the days that you're allowed to leave the house depend on the number of your national ID card; in Serbia a designated dog-walking hour was introduced; and in Belarus the president has gone against medical advice, recommending vodka and saunas as a way to stay safe. Some of the more common approaches have seen governments issue recommendations on social distancing for part or all of the country, while others have acted to restrict all non-essential internal movement. The latter is often called a lockdown. When the virus was first identified in China in late 2019, lockdown seemed extreme. But as the outbreak has spread around the world, it has become more difficult to manage. More countries have opted to take the strictest measures possible to contain it. Well over 100 countries worldwide had instituted either a full or partial lockdown by the end of March 2020, affecting billions of people. And many others had recommended restricted movement for some or all of their citizens. In regions that have only recently confirmed their first cases of coronavirus, many countries appear to be learning from their Asian and European counterparts. Governments seem to be acting faster and more strictly in Africa as well. China has managed to ease its restrictions after passing through the worst period of climbing cases and deaths, but life is still far from normal. The rest of us may have a long way to go. When the virus first appeared, several countries brought in initial restrictions on flights from China, or required visitors from at-risk areas to be quarantined on arrival. After it had been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, on 11 March, there were more all-encompassing measures. President Trump blocked all non-essential arrivals to the US from the European Union on 15 March, and a day later the EU did the same to all visitors from outside the Schengen free-travel zone. By the end of March, air traffic from some of the world's biggest airports had dropped to a fraction of what it was at the same time last year, or even what it was at the start of this month. The number of commercial flights last month was down by more than a quarter globally, according to flight tracking service Flightradar24. In the final week of March, as more and more countries introduced travel restrictions to try to contain the virus, traffic declined 63% from the same period last year. On 25 March, Heathrow - one of the busiest airports in the world serving about 80 million passengers per year - recorded more than 1,000 fewer flights compared with an equivalent day in 2019. It's not just getting from city to city. Travel within major cities across the globe has ground to a halt as restrictions on movement and social contact have come into force. As of 31 March, residents in cities like Madrid, Paris, London and New York were making fewer than one-tenth as many journeys using the app as they did normally, according to data from travel app Citymapper. In Milan in northern Italy, which has been locked down for several weeks now, only 3% of trips were being planned via the Citymapper mobile app, compared with before the outbreak. The data also suggests that people cut down on travel in the days leading up to government-enforced shutdowns. For example, the partial lockdown in Sao Paulo, Brazil's most populous city, came into place on 24 March but trips had already declined sharply the week before. Even in cities where authorities have issued recommendations on social distancing and refrained from imposing strict lockdowns, it appears that people are still restricting their travel. ln Stockholm, Sweden, where the government has avoided draconian measures, issuing guidelines rather than strict rules, the Citymapper data suggests planned trips - which can include both walking and public transport - fell by 70%. Stockholm's public transport company reported last week that passenger numbers on subway and commuter trains had halved. Movement is also below normal rates in some of the Asian cities that Citymapper collects data for, like Hong Kong and Singapore, which have not enforced the type of shutdowns seen elsewhere. The South Korean capital Seoul hasn't come to a standstill like European capitals, despite facing huge numbers of coronavirus cases - a sign of the country's decision to focus on widespread testing and contact tracing rather than social distancing. We see the same behaviour with people on the roads. Major cities around the world were already becoming steadily less busy before official lockdown measures came in, congestion data from location technology specialists TomTom shows. In Tokyo there hasn't been an official lockdown yet, but schools have been shut since the beginning of March. That, and a lack of tourists, could explain why traffic there has been marginally below last year's levels without the sharp downturn obvious elsewhere. In Jakarta, Indonesia, where there has also been no official lockdown, congestion has already dropped to almost zero - similar to Los Angeles and New Delhi which shut down on different dates. The congestion score in the graphic below is an indication of how much longer it would take to make a journey through the city compared with when there is no traffic at all. A rating of 50 means that a trip will take 50% more time than it would if the roads were completely free, for example, so a half-hour drive would become 45 minutes. The regular low points on the chart generally come at weekends. In China there are signs that things are beginning to get back to normal. Traffic levels are back to about half the 2019 level in Beijing and Shanghai but have been steadily growing since the beginning of February following extended Chinese New Year celebrations from 25 January. In Wuhan, where the outbreak originated, traffic levels are still next to zero compared with last year. One of the few positive effects of the shutdown is that there seems to have been a drop in pollution in some parts of the world. Levels of NO2 in the atmosphere fluctuate widely with factors like wind speed, and satellites trying to measure these levels can be hampered by cloud cover. This may explain some of the variability seen over Wuhan and northern Italy between January and March 2019 in the maps below. But in these places, shutdowns have been stricter and in place for longer than elsewhere, and the change in NO2 levels between 2019 and the months of 2020 in which the shutdowns have been in effect appears to be significant. In the UK, and in many other places, the available satellite data does not yet show either way whether the ongoing reduction in economic activity is being accompanied by a corresponding fall in emissions, although some other sources suggest that it is. As countries have shut down, many workers have had to try to continue their office jobs from home. That means video calls and instant messaging have become invaluable workroom tools. The average number of messages sent by users in New York, Paris, London and Berlin has increased by more than a third in just a few weeks. Not everyone has got used to their new ways of working just yet. But - depending on where you are - there could be a good deal of time left to do so.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52242856,Coronavirus: Remembering the NHS workers who have died,"A midwife originally from Hong Kong. A hospital cleaner who became a nurse. A retired village GP who carried on caring for his former patients. Thousands of people in the UK have now died with coronavirus, including doctors, nurses, surgeons and other NHS workers. Tens of NHS workers are known to have died so far, with doctors who came out of retirement among those who have lost their lives. Here are some of their stories. The mother of four was a matron at Hillingdon Hospital, where she cared for older patients with mental health problems and dementia. On Saturday, the trust confirmed her death at Watford General Hospital. Her husband, Gary, said she was devoted to her family - to her daughters, Gemma and Freya, and twin sons, Kyle and Michael. Sara had that unbeatable combination of kindness, selflessness and total determination to get things right for patients, colleague Dr Paul Hopper added. Ms Campbell, a mother of two, was a treasured member of staff who could light up a room with her infectious laugh and bubbly personality, colleagues said. She was often found singing and dancing, entertaining patients and staff, making everyone smile, they added. Ms Campbell was a healthcare support worker who worked at the Velindre Cancer Centre, in Cardiff. She died at the University Hospital Wales in Cardiff on 10 April. Colleagues said the nurse, who was originally from the Philippines and worked at Hammersmith Hospital, in west London, loved his NHS job. Last month, he changed his Facebook profile picture to an image of him wearing a protective mask emblazoned with the words: I can't stay at home, I'm a healthcare worker. He died after going into self-isolation with coronavirus symptoms, a friend and fellow nurse said. The grandmother, who worked at Royal Liverpool University Hospital, was an unsung hero, her local NHS trust said. Her job was to make arrangements to allow patients to safely leave hospital, having spent most of her career as a care worker for people with disabilities. Barbara was a much-loved wife, mum, nan, sister, auntie, friend and beautiful person, her family said. She loved nothing more than spending precious time with her family. A grandfather, Gareth Roberts had worked as a nurse at sites across the Cardiff and Vale health board since the 1980s. He had retired in December 2014 before returning to work in January 2015. He was extremely popular, fun-filled and well-liked, the board said while staff said he was a kind and helpful person. Mr Roberts died at the Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil. Julie Omar had been working as a sister on Ward 14 at the Alexandra Hospital in Redditch, and had also previously worked with the trauma team at Worcestershire Royal Hospital. She was a much-loved member of its nursing team, said the Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, and a dedicated and highly experienced trauma and orthopaedics nurse. She died at home on 10 April, and leaves a husband, Laith, and a grown-up daughter. A married father-of-two, Dr Chowdhury was a consultant urologist at Homerton University Hospital, in east London. His son Intisar described the consultant urologist as a kind and compassionate hero who had been in such pain when he wrote an appeal to the government on Facebook, warning about a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) for NHS workers. He wrote that post while he was in that state, just because of how much he cared about his co-workers, his son said. Family friend and fellow doctor Golam Rahat Khan said Dr Chowdhury liked singing, and enjoyed celebrating Bengali and English culture and heritage. He was so caring, he would call us very often to come to his house, he added. Dr Chowdhury died on 8 April. Dr Edmond Adedeji worked as a locum registrar in the emergency department of Great Western Hospital in Swindon, Wiltshire. He died doing a job he loved, serving others before himself, his family said in a statement. The hospital's chief executive added he was a respected and well-liked member of the team. Dr Adedeji died on 8 April. Ms Ong loved her job, her daughter Melissa told the PA news agency. She said her mother came to London from Hong Kong in the 1970s to join the NHS because she believed it was the best in the world. Ms Ong began her career as a midwife and was working full-time at two surgeries and holding baby clinics before falling ill. She died on 7 April. Sister Leilani Dayrit died of suspected coronavirus after displaying symptoms at work, her daughter has said. Mary Dayrit, 19, said her mother had been selfless until the very end and put other people's wellbeing before her own. She had asthma, and had been self-isolating at home for seven days before she died on 7 April. She had stopped breathing and paramedics were unable to revive her. Mary said her mother was a compassionate woman who made sure to spread joy, happiness and love to anyone that ever needed it. Ms Graham was the first NHS worker in Scotland to die from coronavirus. My Mum was there for me no matter what. I will miss everything about her, her son told STV News. A healthcare support worker and district nurse, Ms Graham died at Inverclyde Royal Hospital on 6 April. Our father was a selfless and compassionate doctor for over 50 years, Dr Haider's daughter told the BBC after the death of the GP, who served as a senior partner at Valance Medical Centre, in Dagenham, east London. His dedication to help people everywhere, be it professionally or personally was unwavering. We are truly astounded as to how many people have reached out to share a story of his kindness, and continue to receive touching tributes from colleagues, patients, friends and family alike, Samina Haider said. Dr Haider, who died on 6 April, also worked for more than 30 years as a senior homeopathic physician at the Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine. Ms O'Rourke was such a kind and caring nurse who had a really special relationship with her patients and colleagues, said the ward manager of the acute medical unit she worked in. Nursing was something she had always wanted to do, although she came to it relatively late after raising her girls. The 39-year-old died at the hospital where she worked - the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Hospital, in Margate, Kent - on 2 April. Ms Nasreen worked as a hospital cleaner before gaining her nursing qualification in 2019. She died on 2 April at Walsall Manor Hospital, in the West Midlands - the hospital she had worked at for 16 years. We've lost an amazing nurse, but we've lost also an amazing person in life, her sister Kazeema Nasreen said. The chief executive of Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust said Ms Nasreen always said she was so blessed to have the role of a nurse, which she absolutely loved because she wanted to feel like she could make a difference - and you did, Areema, you will be very sadly missed. The grandmother followed her dream and trained as a midwife in later life, her family said in a statement. She was a very well-respected midwife who supported many hundreds of women as they welcomed their babies into the world, they added. Ms Coventry had worked at the Princess Alexandra Hospital, in Harlow, Essex, for 10 years. She died on 2 April. Ms Sharma, who worked as a pharmacist at Eastbourne District General Hospital, was the superstar of the family, her brother said. Her irresistible laugh, sense of humour and good nature would light up our world and fill it with colours. For this I am eternally grateful that Pooja was my sister. For me, Pooja would always be the little protector or shield for when I had done something mischievous and she would cover for me with my parents. Dr Ayache stopped working a month before he died, but his family say they think he continued to visit patients in their homes in an effort to help. The retired GP, who worked for the NHS in Suffolk for more than 40 years, would often pop round and just check [former patients] were OK, his daughter Layla Ayache said. He was a rural village GP at heart, she added. He had also helped to raise money for refugee charities to help people in Syria, where he was born. Ms Ayache said her father's entire life was split between his family and his work, adding: That was all he lived for really, was those two things. He died on 8 April. Father-of-two Jitendra Rathod was a dearly loved specialist heart surgeon at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, where he spent 25 years. The health board's chief executive said he was a great surgeon who would be missed by his colleagues. Mr Rathod died in the intensive care ward at the hospital on 6 April. The nurse had worked in the children's cancer unit at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary before taking up other roles in the health sector. She was a devoted friend, an incredible nurse and an unapologetically imperfect person, one of her friends said in a Facebook post. Ms Mack was not believed to have been directly dealing with patients before becoming ill. She died on 5 April. A healthcare assistant, Mr Corbin worked at the Park Royal Centre for Mental Health, in north-west London, for more than 25 years. He was the 'go to' person who knew everything about the ward and how to get things done, said Claire Murdoch, head of the local NHS trust, adding he was the backbone of his team. Mr Corbin died on 4 April. A published historian, Dr Sebastianpillai trained at a medical school in Sri Lanka and went on to specialise in treating elderly people at Kingston Hospital in south-west London. He was hugely respected as a consultant and author, Ed Davey, acting Lib Dem leader, said. He described the consultant geriatrician's book, A Complete Illustrated History of Sri Lanka, as world class. Dr Sebastianpillai, who was in his 70s, died on 4 April. Ms Glanister was a long-serving nurse at the Aintree University Hospital, in Liverpool. We are so proud to see just how many people's lives Liz has touched, her family said in a statement. Losing a loved one at any time is heartbreaking, but to go through it as we and many other families are is simply beyond words. Ms Glanister - pictured centre, below - died on 3 April at Royal Liverpool University Hospital. We are sorry to announce that another member of our nursing family, Liz Glanister, has sadly passed away from COVID-19. pic.twitter.com/8ncTE1ceVF End of Twitter post by @NursingNotesUK Prof Shousha was an honorary professor of histopathology at Imperial College London, and had worked at UK cancer research laboratories at London's Hammersmith and Charing Cross hospitals since 1978. He died on 2 April. Living legend Dr Alfa Saadu, who had returned to work after retirement, died in hospital on 31 March. His family said he had been working part-time at the Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital in Welwyn, Hertfordshire, before contracting the virus. His son Dani Saadu said the family suggested he should go to hospital, but his father insisted he did not want to take up a hospital bed because others would need it. Mr Saadu added: He was a very passionate man, who cared about saving people... he loved to lecture people in the world of medicine, he did so in the UK and Africa. Father-of-seven Thomas Harvey, 57, was a healthcare assistant at Goodmayes Hospital in Ilford, east London. His family criticised the NHS for the lack of personal protective equipment provided to staff, saying he just had gloves and a flimsy apron. He died at home on 29 March, after feeling unwell for several days. An ear, nose and throat consultant at the University Hospitals of Derby and Burton, Mr El-Hawrani's family said he was a loving and much-loved husband, son, father, brother, and friend. His greatest passions were his family and his profession, and he dedicated his life to both, they said. Mr El-Hawrani died at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester on 28 March. Dr Zaidi was a managing partner of a GP practice with his wife Dr Talat Zaidi. Their four children all work in the medical profession. His daughter, Dr Sarah Zaidi, said his death was reflective of his sacrifice and he had a vocational attitude to service. His colleague Dr Jose Garcia-Lobera said he had left behind an incredible legacy and was a hugely respected, selfless man who dedicated his life to helping others. Dr Zaidi died in intensive care at Southend Hospital, Essex, on 25 March. Renowned surgeon Dr El Tayar worked in the NHS for 11 years before moving back to his native Sudan to help establish a transplant programme. He returned to the UK in 2015, working as a locum surgeon before his death. He gave the precious gift of life to so many people around the world, fellow surgeon Abbas Ghazanfar wrote in a tribute. He was an excellent colleague, a truly humble soul and above all a noble human being. He died at West Middlesex University Hospital in Isleworth, west London, on 25 March."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/52124740,Coronavirus: Fake and misleading stories that went viral this week,"We've all been there. A coronavirus post that could be true and sounds about right, but how do we know it's accurate? To help, the BBC's disinformation-monitoring team is fact-checking and verifying some of the most widely shared fake and misleading stories of the week. Residents of Brooklyn, in New York City, rapping in unison to one of The Notorious B.I.G.'s biggest hits during lockdown sounds plausible, doesn't it? A video claiming exactly that has been shared thousands of times and clocked-up more than one million views in a few days. The video, shot from a tall building somewhere in New York, scans across apartment buildings that are apparently blaring out the song Juicy by deceased Brooklyn rapper Biggie. However, the posts are fake. We know this because we found that, tipped off by a comment on one of the posts, the recording appears to be a match for a video from a Jay-Z concert in 2010. We also pinpointed the video to Manhattan not Brooklyn - probably the Upper West Side. So the video does not show a mass singalong that, if you read the comments, gave people goose bumps. A video claiming to show people in China tearing down a 5G mobile antenna was shared on social media and has generated thousands of views. Actor Woody Harrelson, who has two million Instagram followers, posted the video, saying: Meanwhile the Chinese are bringing 5g antennas down. The video is genuine but it's old and shows protesters in Hong Kong in August 2019 tearing down what was reported to be a smart lamppost equipped to collect data. 5G is the latest high-speed mobile broadband technology which requires new antenna masts to be installed to maintain the network. The video was shared as false rumours about a link between 5G and coronavirus spread on social media. Posts claiming that inhaling steam has helped coronavirus patients' recovery have been spreading across social media this week. One example has been shared more than 40,000 times. It appears to come from a Facebook user in Durham, who wrote that he heard first hand that a doctor who had Corona virus recovered in double quick time after inhaling steam. A similar message has taken different forms - coming from someone's sister in London, Queens NY and a sister from Pakistan. There's no evidence that steam inhalation works as a treatment for coronavirus. This advice is also potentially harmful. High-temperature steam-cleaning of surfaces in hospitals and elsewhere does destroy the coronavirus (as well as other types of viruses) says Prof Keith Neal, a specialist in the study of the spread of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham. However, any attempt to inhale steam at this temperature, would be extremely dangerous and risk burns. Your body's cooling system would kick in to limit the rise in temperature, says Prof Neal, and your lungs would certainly be irreparably damaged before reaching a temperature high enough to deactivate the virus. Posts with images of hospital beds and patients being treated on the streets are going viral on social media with the claim that hospitals in Italy have run out of space due to the spread of coronavirus. The images being shared are genuine, but they are not from Italy. A reverse image search reveals they were taken in the Croatian capital, Zagreb, after it was hit by an earthquake on 22 March. The most widely shared post seems to have originated in India just as the government there imposed a nationwide lockdown on 25 March. It has been shared more than 17,000 times and is now being posted by users outside India. Indian journalist Rajat Sharma, also tweeted the images with the misleading claim. He deleted the post within a few hours but it had already been retweeted more than 6,000 times. A Russian scientist has said that a man-made bacterium has somehow merged with the new coronavirus and is the reason people are dying - and recommends baking soda to treat it. The interview appeared on a popular Russian YouTube channel and has had more than four million views. But there's no evidence to support this - the disease Covid-19 is caused by the coronavirus alone. It's also not the case that baking soda can help if you are infected with coronavirus, or prevent infection from it. Some misleading online posts are difficult to spot because they contain both good and bad medical advice. You can be drawn in by the good from what appears to be a reputable source and then can be caught off guard when bad advice is thrown into the mix. A good example of this is a message attributed to Johns Hopkins University in the US. It has been widely shared in various forms, sometimes attributed to a medical expert, Irene Ken, suggesting ways to avoid the contagion. There is some sensible advice in there, such as washing your hands or that vodka is not a strong enough alcohol to kill the virus. Other parts of it, however, are inaccurate - among them that Listerine, a brand of mouthwash, is 65% alcohol (it's much less than that). We have seen rumors about #COVID19 circulating on social media that cite a Johns Hopkins immunologist and infectious disease expert. We do not know the origin of these rumors. Get credible information from Johns Hopkins University and Medicine experts: https://t.co/8yP58VAR0N End of Twitter post by @JohnsHopkins The Johns Hopkins University says it had nothing to do with any of these posts.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/52216330,Coronavirus: Bogus Jeff Bezos message and other misleading stories unpicked,"BBC teams are fact-checking and verifying some of the most popular fake and misleading coronavirus stories on social media. Jack Goodman brings together what's been debunked this week by BBC Monitoring, Trending and Reality Check. You might remember a beautiful message about coronavirus that Bill Gates didn't actually write. Here's another fake quote attributed to a billionaire. This time a statement that Jeff Bezos didn't make about Bill Gates. Amazon confirmed the quote is fake. Identical posts falsely claimed that the Amazon founder Mr Bezos had sent a strong message to Africans about Covid-19 and that Bill Gates was looking to destabilise Africa. Africans were to avoid wearing certain face masks because they contained toxic substances, it adds. The same bogus post in French has been copied and pasted by hundreds of accounts. The original one appears to be from an account in DR Congo set up in January and has been shared more than 30,000 times. Scientists have called rumours that there is a link between 5G technology and coronavirus complete rubbish and a biological impossibility. However, there are still false claims circulating on Facebook, Instagram and Tik Tok. A post shared thousands of times links new technology to various outbreaks of diseases - claiming 1G coincided with the influenza outbreak in 1979, 2G with an outbreak of cholera and links 5G to Covid-19. This is false - there is no evidence whatsoever that these events are related. Photographs of posters on lampposts claim there was never a Covid-19 and that 5G is the real cause of the deaths. Again, this claim is false. Claims that Britain has pulled out of a 5G contract with Chinese internet company Huawei after testing kits were contaminated with coronavirus have been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter in English, Arabic, Portuguese and French. However, Britain's deal with Huawei is still in place. And there's no evidence testing kits have been contaminated with coronavirus. Then there's the conspiracy theory linking coronavirus and 5G technology to the new £20 note. Numerous social media posts point to what appears to be a representation of the virus above what they say is a 5G telecom tower on the reverse of the note. However, as the Bank of England pointed out when the design was revealed, the coronavirus is actually the Rotunda at the Tate Britain art gallery, while the phone tower is Margate Lighthouse. A voice note you may have heard of a woman who claims she works for Secas - the South East Coast Ambulance Service and is sharing inside information that comes from Public Health England is not accurate. This is fake news, and we would urge people to ignore the message and not share it further, says Viv Bennett, chief nurse at Public Health England (PHE). In the note the woman suggests further restrictions on movement are imminent and that a huge proportion of the people dying of coronavirus are healthy and young. We are aware of a voice message being shared currently on social media regarding the ambulance response to coronavirus. The alarmist information being shared in the message is not correct. We would urge people to disregard the message and not share it further. End of Twitter post by @SECAmbulance Secas said that the alarmist information being shared in the message is not correct. Dozens of people sent the note to BBC reporters, and Secas and PHE fielded enquiries, indicating that the message went viral on WhatsApp's network. A popular WhatsApp message claims that when Indians took part in collective applause to celebrate the nation's emergency services in March, it caused such an racket that Nasa satellites detected cosmic level sound waves from it, which made coronavirus retreat. Sounds far-fetched? Well, yes. The message appeared two weeks ago but we know people are still sharing it despite an official denial from the Indian government. This is #Fake News!NO such Announcement has been made by NASA Practicing social distancing, respiratory hygiene and washing hands are the effective steps to defeat #CoronavirusInIndia #IndiaFightsCorona pic.twitter.com/hBRLv9crUE End of Twitter post by @PIBFactCheck Inaccurate claims that a Harvard professor has just been arrested for creating the coronavirus emerged this week and went viral after being reported in multiple languages and shared hundreds of thousands of times. The posts say that Charles Lieber has just been arrested in the United States and that he manufactured coronavirus and sold it to China. Mr Lieber was charged in January this year for lying about connections to China. But not for manufacturing or selling the new coronavirus to China - none of the charges are related to Covid-19. Many of the posts included the same local US news clip from January. It was posted on a Spanish Facebook page for natural recipes and shared more than 250,000 times. Genome sequencing of this coronavirus suggests it jumped from animals to humans and was not man-made. A video in Spanish that has more than seven million views recommends gargling salt water to prevent Covid-19 infection. The presenter says that salt water is the best common ingredient to protect against coronavirus. Some people gargle salt to relieve symptoms of a dry sore throat, says the WHO, but there's no evidence it has any effect on Covid-19.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51768274,Coronavirus UK map: How many confirmed cases are there in your area?,"The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK has reached more than 84,000. A total of 10,612 people confirmed to have had the virus have died. The actual number of those with the respiratory infection in the UK is estimated to be much higher though - as it is mostly those in hospital and some NHS staff who are currently being tested. Almost 280,000 people have been tested for coronavirus so far.

Northern Ireland local authority figures Monday to Friday only. If you can't see the look-up click here. The following charts and graphics will help you understand the situation in the UK and how the authorities are responding. The number of people confirmed to have had coronavirus and died has risen by 737 to 10,612. The UK becomes the fifth country to surpass 10,000 deaths, joining the US, Spain, Italy and France. The BBC's head of statistics Robert Cuffe says that although growth in the number of deaths has stalled over the last few days, it is possible that some deaths may be unreported until the end of the Bank Holiday weekend. The majority of the deaths have been in England, with 9,594 deaths in total. In Scotland, 566 people have died so far, while the figure in Wales is 369. Northern Ireland has seen a total of 118 deaths. Most deaths have been among the elderly. Figures released by NHS England show more than half of deaths have been among people aged over 80. The UK's overall death figure, which is confirmed cases reported up to 17:00 BST the previous day, is almost entirely made up from those people who died in hospital and tested positive for coronavirus. For the most part it does not include deaths in the community, for example in care homes, or people who have died in their own homes. This means that the true death toll will be higher. Most deaths so far have occurred in London, but the Midlands has also been badly affected. The new coronavirus, which causes the respiratory disease known as Covid-19, was first confirmed in the UK at the end of January. While there were a number of people testing positive throughout February, figures in the UK began to increase at the beginning of March. Prime Minister Boris Johnson who tested positive for the virus has been released from hospital after spending three nights in intensive care. He thanked hospital workers for saving his life. A number of temporary Nightingale hospitals are being set up across the country to increase the NHS's ability to deal with the crisis. The new hospitals will treat patients in makeshift critical care units at: Another hospital will also be established at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff - though this is not classed as a Nightingale facility. Retired NHS staff have been asked to return to work. A government appeal for volunteers to help deliver food and medicine to the vulnerable has prompted more than 750,000 responses. At the moment, the number of confirmed cases and deaths in the UK remains lower than some other European countries. For example, in Italy there have been more than 150,000 confirmed cases and nearly 20,000 deaths. But while the increase in the number of deaths each day appears to be slowing in Italy, in the UK the number is still rising - albeit at a slower rate than a week ago. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has set a target of 100,000 tests per day by the end of April - a big jump from the previous target of 25,000 per day by mid-April. On 11 April more than 18,000 coronavirus tests were carried out and in total about 282,000 people in the UK have been tested. Most of the tests so far have been reserved for seriously ill patients in hospital. But on Friday the government began to publish figures which included key workers and their households, as well as hospital patients. Previously, the testing of key workers and their families had not been included in the daily figures. Increasing the number of people being tested for coronavirus will play a key part in analysing its spread in the UK. The government's action plan for dealing with the virus involves three phases - contain; delay; mitigate - alongside ongoing research. After trying to contain the disease, the country moved to the delay phase on 12 March to stop the wider spread of the virus. Even if you have no symptoms, the government says you should: Police have been given powers to fine people deliberately flouting the restrictions, with increasing penalties for repeat offenders. The government is now encouraging self-isolation at home for over 70s, and those more vulnerable to the virus, for 12 weeks. British nationals should avoid all non-essential foreign travel to tackle the spread of coronavirus, the Foreign Office has advised. Symptoms include a high temperature and a new, continuous cough - this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or three or more coughing episodes in 24 hours (if you usually have a cough, it may be worse than usual). If you think you have coronavirus you are advised not to go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital. Instead, you stay at home for seven days. If you live with other people, you should keep at least 2m away from them and they should also stay home for 14 days to see if they develop symptoms. If your symptoms persist or worsen you should contact the NHS's dedicated 111 online coronavirus service or call 111."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-52187500,Virtual pub quiz: How to run one that's actually good,"We used Zoom for meetings anyway. So now I've got the flipchart out and we're doing Trivial Pursuit on it as well. Jess Southworth works in sales for a hotel in Manchester. But lately, she says, I've sort of turned into a virtual quizmaster. It's the same old story - well, in 2020 anyway. End up on lockdown. Can't see your mates in person. And before you know it - you're doing Pointless in your living room. I'm at home at the moment but we've got about 200 people in our team and we try to stay in touch, says Jess. They started with three quick-fire questions a day on WhatsApp to stay entertained. But after more than two weeks working from home they've been getting more creative. I began posting ten questions a day on the work Facebook with a different theme - yesterday it was the Tudors, she says. On Friday I was doing three different quizzes. One quick search of Twitter and you'll find loads of online pub quizzes, whether it's on Zoom or House Party, with hundreds of people around the world taking part. There's even the odd one hosted by a politician. Who better to ask than Eggheads host and Radio 2 presenter Jeremy Vine? That's actually a question Jeremy wouldn't approve of - his first tip, which is much harder than it sounds, is to make sure the question you're asking only has one answer. If you say 'Who is the son of Queen Elizabeth II?' That could be Prince Charles, Prince Andrew or Prince Edward, he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. So that's not a good question. Tip number two: Jeremy says the best questions are the really simple ones. On Eggheads we had 'What colour is Noddy's hat? A lot of people say red - but it's actually blue. So far, so straightforward. But what if, as quizmaster, you don't know the answer to a question yourself? Jess relies on the internet for some of her answers and that can prove tricky. If everyone starts arguing with the answers - what do you do? she asks. Jeremy's advice on that? The key thing with being a quiz setter is: never let anyone ask you a question, because then they'll realise how little you actually know. The presenter suggests making sure you study up on a few vital subjects though - you can't be a great quizmaster without putting in a bit of work. You've got to know the presidents of the USA and the vice presidents, you've got to know oceans, geography, currencies, and kings and queens. And if you don't know kings and queens you can just know Henry VIII. If you know him or his wives, you've got a chance in any quiz. For Nicol Martinez, a virtual pub quiz for her family of 15 has been a perfect activity - but it hasn't been without its controversy. We wrote our answers on a piece of paper and sent our answers to the host. As far as we're aware no-one cheated, but there were obviously some accusations! the 25-year-old says. The biggest issue though was getting everyone on. We tried to get nan involved - she's in her late 80s - but she couldn't download the app so she couldn't get involved. Jeremy says Britain is the most fanatically quizzy country - which is why he says Eggheads is very popular in this country but hasn't sold to that many countries abroad. In this country, knowledge and information is status. People love to know stuff. So a final tip: if you're planning a quiz for lockdown, take it seriously - because your teams certainly will be.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52193264,Coronavirus: What is intensive care and which patients need it?,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson is now being treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) at St Thomas' hospital in London. Downing Street says it is a precaution, on the recommendation of his doctors, should he need more complex care. ICUs are specialist wards set up to provide treatment and close monitoring for patients who are too seriously ill to be cared for in other parts of the hospital. They have fewer patients and more staffing to provide one-on-one care when its needed. And they are kitted out with sophisticated monitoring equipment. There are 500 intensive care beds at the newly-opened NHS Nightingale Hospital. There are many different reasons why a person might need this type of care. Some patients need it for recovery after intense surgery. Others need it after severe trauma, following a road traffic accident, for example. The PM has been moved there as a precaution because his symptoms of coronavirus infection have not improved. He was admitted to St Thomas' on Sunday with a persistent symptoms, including a fever. Coronavirus can attack the lungs and it appears that the PM is now having difficulties with his breathing, although he is not yet on a ventilator machine for this. Not every patient in ICU with coronavirus will need a ventilator to take over the job of breathing. Some may be put on a breathing support machine called CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) that uses mild pressure to push oxygen into the airways via a mask. Patients can be awake and not sedated for this, unlike those who need a ventilator. Patients on ICU will be connected to lots of different machines, via tubes, wires and cables, to monitor how their body is coping. And they can be given intravenous drugs and other supportive treatments, including nutrition. St Thomas' has experience in treating coronavirus patients in its ICU. For extremely serious cases it can use a life support machine called ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) which replaces some of the function of the heart and lungs. There are only a handful of these machines around the country. As soon as someone is well enough, they will be moved back out of intensive care to another hospital ward. This frees up the bed for another patient who urgently needs it. Some patients can leave after a few days, but others may need to be there for weeks or months."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/52149297,Coronavirus: How England lags behind other UK nations on testing,"Official data suggests testing for coronavirus per head of population in England has been considerably slower so far than that in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. As of 8 April, 343 people have been tested per 100,000 of the UK population, according to the Department of Health and Social Care. These are diagnostic swab tests to establish whether an individual is infected by coronavirus. Across the four nations, the numbers break down as follows: That means that up to 8 April, 79% of the people tested in the UK were in England, despite England having roughly 84% of the country's population. England has also had 83% of confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK so far, and 91% of deaths recorded in hospitals. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has already said the government has a huge amount of work to do to meet its target of 100,000 coronavirus tests a day in the UK by the end of April. And the slower pace of testing in England has raised further concern because much of the procurement and allocation of tests has now been centralised for all four nations. Experts say England has far more laboratories than the other UK nations, and it is important to create a uniform testing platform so all labs are testing in exactly the same way. But Dr Bharat Pankhania, senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter medical school, says accreditation of labs has been too slow. This is nothing to do with capacity, he says, capacity can be expanded very quickly, and there are plenty of labs. This is a simple test and we just need to get on with it. We don't need this stranglehold by Public Health England [PHE]. When asked to comment on the slower pace of testing in England so far, PHE pointed out that it is not directly responsible for laboratory accreditation. That's the job of the United Kingdom Accreditation Service, although it is up to PHE and the Department of Health to ask for certain standards to be maintained. PHE has moved heaven and earth to develop an accurate test, ensuring that every hospital patient that needs one has been tested, said PHE's chief executive Duncan Selbie in a statement. We and our NHS colleagues have delivered our promise of 10,000 tests a day on time and are on track for 750,000 tests per month [25,000 per day] by the end of April, he said. We have supported NHS laboratories to get their COVID-19 testing up and running, to make sure the tests they are using provide accurate results. That of course does not explain the discrepancy in testing figures between different nations within the UK so far. The pace of testing in England has been increasing over the past week, but a rapid acceleration may only happen when private laboratories join those run by public health bodies. One new testing facility is being developed by the pharmaceutical companies AstraZeneca and GSK with the University of Cambridge. We believe we will start testing by mid-April, AstraZeneca's CEO Pascal Soriot told the BBC's Today programme, and be at scale with 30,000 tests a day by early May. All four nations are also obviously trying to increase testing as much as possible in public health facilities as part of the UK-wide effort. The Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said NHS Scotland's testing capacity in hospitals would increase to at least 3,500 a day by the end of this month, at the latest. She said that figure should be compared to the pillar one target in England of 25,000 tests a day - done in NHS and public health laboratories - by the end of April. This piece was published on 3 April and updated on 8 April to include the latest figures. Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter"
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51506729,Coronavirus: What are social distancing and self-isolation rules?,"Sunny and warm weather in parts of the UK this Easter weekend has prompted the government to appeal for people to stick to restrictions on movement to curb the spread of coronavirus. Police also have wide-ranging powers to help fight coronavirus by enforcing the social distancing measures. These say people should go out as little as possible and only leave if they have a reasonable excuse. This includes: If you have to go outside you should stay more than 2m (6ft) apart from anyone other than members of your own household. This is what's known as social distancing. No mention is given to how long you can exercise for. But Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has suggested a walk of up to an hour, a run of 30 minutes or a cycle ride of between that might be appropriate more most people depending on their level of fitness. Social distancing is important because coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can be breathed in, or can cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on, and then touch your face with unwashed hands. If you show symptoms of coronavirus - such as a dry cough and high temperature - you must take extra precautions. You should stay at home and if possible, not leave it for any reason. This is known as self-isolation. If possible, you should not go out even to buy food or other essentials. If you are unable to get supplies delivered, you should do what you can to limit social contact when you do leave the house. Everyone who shows coronavirus symptoms - a fever of above 37.8C, a persistent cough or breathing problems - and everyone who lives in the same house or flat as someone with symptoms. The person with the symptoms should stay in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened, and keep away from other people in the home. People are being advised not to ring NHS 111 or their GP to report their symptoms unless they are worried. About 1.5 million people with very serious health conditions are being contacted by the NHS and urged not go out at all for at least 12 weeks. This is what's known as shielding. The most vulnerable group includes: The government says it will work with local authorities, supermarkets and the armed forces to ensure they get supplies of essential food and medicines. Others in the same household, and carers, can go out as long they observe proper social distancing."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52040138,Coronavirus: How can I shop or get deliveries and takeaways safely?,"Remember a time - just a few weeks ago - when a trip to the supermarket wasn't restricted to the basic necessities to be done as infrequently as possible? Those were the words Boris Johnson used about the new approach to shopping as he outlined the government's curbs on daily life, to limit the spread of coronavirus. He said people should use food delivery services where you can. But what are the safest ways to go shopping for food or accept a delivery or takeaway at home? Coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can cause an infection if they are breathed in, or potentially if you touch a surface they have landed on. So going shopping and mixing with other people does carry a risk. That is why social distancing - keeping at least 2m (about 6ft) from others - is so important, and many shops are enforcing it. Supermarkets can provide an ideal setting for virus transfer, says Prof Sally Bloomfield, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Many people are touching and replacing items, checkout belts, cash cards, car park ticket machine buttons, ATM payment buttons, paper receipts etc... Not to mention being in the proximity of several other people. There are ways to offset these risks: There is no evidence of Covid-19 being transmitted through food, and thorough cooking will kill the virus. The UK Food Standards Agency website has advice on food safety at home. But while there is no such thing as zero risk, says Prof Bloomfield, it is packaging - handled by other people - that is a chief concern. Online advice for food businesses says: Food packaging is not known to present a specific risk. However, some independent experts have additional advice. For contained or packaged goods, says Prof Bloomfield, either store them for 72 hours before using them or spray and wipe plastic or glass containers with bleach [that is carefully diluted as directed on the bottle]. For unwrapped fresh goods, which could have been handled by anyone - wash thoroughly under running water and leave to dry, she adds. Delivery slots permitting, a home drop is less risky than a trip to a supermarket as you will avoid other shoppers. The risk is possible contamination of the surface of any food or package, or from the delivery driver. Food safety expert and blogger Dr Lisa Ackerley suggests leaving a note on your front door asking the driver to ring the bell and step back. This would allow you to safely pick up your food, alone. What about the networks of volunteers springing up to help local vulnerable and elderly people? To remove any fear of the virus being on surfaces, Dr James Gill, of Warwick Medical School, advises: Wiping over surfaces with simple diluted household bleach will inactivate the virus within one minute. Prof Alison Sinclair, a virology expert from the University of Sussex, adds: There should be no more risk from using an online delivery service than using a friend or volunteer collecting the groceries for you. Some experts also advise using plastic bags only once during this pandemic. Many local restaurants have repurposed their businesses as takeaways. Reputable chains and good restaurant kitchens are most likely to be geared towards professional, hygienic food preparation, so there would be minimal risk from a freshly cooked takeaway meal. The risk of packaging contamination can be minimised, Prof Bloomfield advises, by emptying the contents [into a clean dish], disposing of the packaging into a refuse bag and washing your hands thoroughly before you eat. Take food out of a container with a spoon and eat it with a knife and fork - not your fingers. It might be better in the current circumstances to order hot, freshly cooked food, rather than cold or raw items. The Food Standards Agency does stress that the risk from food is low and that there is no reason to avoid having ready-to-eat food delivered if it has been prepared and handled properly. For the most cautious and the most vulnerable though, careful preparation and cooking may be reassuring. With a pizza for example, if you wanted to be really safe, you could even pop it into the microwave for a couple of minutes, Prof Bloomfield adds. Follow Victoria on Twitter"
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-52269852,Coronavirus: London bus driver 'frightened to die',"A London bus driver has said she is frightened to die and begged the government to do more to help protect transport staff. Lorraine, 62, who covers south London routes, said she had written letters to relatives in fear she could not say goodbye if she contracted the virus. Eighteen London transport staff, including 12 bus workers, have died after contracting Covid-19 so far. The Mayor of London said everything was being done to keep workers safe. In a video posted online, Lorraine said she wanted her children and family to have the letters as she is put at risk by Transport for London (TfL) for not providing a safe working environment. I am proud to drive a London bus, I'm proud to do my job, I'm proud to get front line services to their place of work to help people. That's why I'm still driving, she said. But I'm frightened. I'm frightened that I'm going to die, because nobody in government, [Sadiq] Khan, TfL, will not listen to us. Lorraine added that more needed to be done about those roaming the streets. I've had people day after after day get on my bus for no reason, putting me at risk, she said. It's not fair. My life matters, if it doesn't matter to anybody else it matters to my family. Mr Khan said: There are clearly issues in the supply of PPE, with hospitals and care homes reporting shortages. But I've also asked TfL to look into the availability of PPE stock for transport workers, in case advice from public health experts changes. Public Health England's current advice is that PPE should only be used in care settings. The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union said transport staff should stop working if they were not provided with adequate safety equipment. TfL said an enhanced anti-viral cleaning regime had been launched across the network and protective films applied to the screens of bus driver cabs."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52269426,Coronavirus: Gown supply 'critically low' in some hospitals,"An NHS boss has warned the number of protective gowns available to front-line staff in parts of the country has become critically low in recent days. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers in England, has called for a more sustainable supply of gowns, which are imported from China. On Sunday, the health secretary said the amount of available PPE - personal protective equipment - was increasing. It came as deaths in UK hospitals rose to 11,329 - up by 717 since Sunday. The Department of Health said a further 4,342 people had tested positive for coronavirus as of 09:00 BST on Monday. Meanwhile, a review of the UK's lockdown measures will take place later this week. Mr Hopson, from NHS Providers in England which represents hospital trusts, told BBC Breakfast that the number of protective gowns available to NHS staff in some parts of the country was very, very low. Mr Hopson said that the NHS ordered a whole load of stock weeks ago, but delays have been caused by the gowns sometimes failing safety tests, while other batches have been mislabelled - meaning the NHS has ended up with additional masks. He added: If everything had been flowing exactly as had been ordered and if all of the material had properly passed its safety test, there would not be an issue. This is all really hand-to-mouth in terms of gown delivery, and we need to get to a more sustainable supply. At the government's daily briefing on Sunday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government was working night and day to make sure we get the right PPE. I'm glad to say there are now record amounts [of PPE] in the system, he said, adding: Daily we're delivering millions of items to the frontline. On gowns, he said: In the last two days 121,000 gowns have been delivered around the country and more are going out today and in the week to come. Mr Hopson said that the vast majority of preparations for the outbreak within the NHS had gone well, with nearly all stocks of PPE flowing in the way that trusts would like. The bit where there's a particular problem was gowns, he said. We know that over the last 72 hours some trusts have run critically low on gowns. No trust, as far as I'm aware, has actually run out but some of the stocks are very, very low. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has confirmed public services will receive more than £14bn from the government's coronavirus emergency response fund, including more than £6bn for health services. The Treasury said the funding would go towards freeing up hospital beds and delivering urgent priorities such as acquiring ventilators, diagnostic tests and protective equipment for NHS staff. A gown is a piece of PPE used to protect the body of those who might come into contact with coronavirus. It should be made of water-resistant material and have long sleeves. If the gown is not water resistant, a waterproof apron is needed underneath to protect the wearer from droplets containing the virus. The World Health Organization says gowns should be worn by all doctors, nurses and cleaners who enter coronavirus patients' rooms in hospitals. They should also be used by those handling coronavirus samples in labs and healthcare workers, cleaners and ambulance crews in places where patients with suspected coronavirus symptoms are seen. It comes as Downing Street denied that cabinet minister Michael Gove's daughter being tested for coronavirus was an example of double standards. Tests are not yet available for most people and mainly reserved for seriously ill patients in hospital. The prime minister's spokesman said the test was carried out on the advice of the chief medical officer and in line with medical guidance. The spokesman said Mr Gove's job is a central role in the government's response and the test meant he could get back to work. Latest government figures show 18,000 tests were carried out on Saturday. There are 23 drive-through testing sites now open for NHS staff, No 10 said. Meanwhile, No 10 has said Mr Johnson will recover at Chequers - the PM's official country residence - as it was considered to be a suitable place. The spokesman added Mr Johnson will not be carrying out government work. Mr Raab is currently in charge of running the government. On Sunday, Mr Johnson thanked NHS staff after being discharged from hospital in London, where he was being treated for Covid-19 - the disease caused by the coronavirus. It is unclear whether the prime minister will take part in the lockdown review, which is due to be carried out by Thursday. Wales' health minister said last week that the lockdown would remain for several more weeks at the very least. And Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned there was no likelihood or prospect of measures being lifted after the Easter weekend. NHS England said on Monday that a further 667 patients with coronavirus had died in the country, while a further 15 deaths were recorded in Wales, and a further nine in Scotland. Recently widowed Hannah - not her real name - has told how her husband of more than 40 years died after contracting coronavirus. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that her husband was in hospital for about a week before he died, and was put on a CPAP machine, which delivers oxygen to the lungs without needing a ventilator, to aid his breathing during that time. Describing his death, she said his breathing was really laboured. It is not a nice, quiet way to go, she said. Hannah added: This is such a cruel disease. Apart from the medical staff that he saw when he had to, [my husband] was alone for a week. Wendy's father fell ill with coronavirus around a month ago and he has now been taken off a ventilator in hospital. They've given him medication to keep him calm and relaxed and it is a matter of just waiting now for him to fade away peacefully, she told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire. The nurses are with him, they are holding his hand, they've been absolutely marvellous, Wendy added. We had to make the decision for the ventilator to be removed and for him to pass away peacefully. Sam Monaghan, the head of the UK's largest charity care provider MHA, told BBC Breakfast that about 150 of its residents had died with confirmed or suspected coronavirus, as well as two staff members. It comes as 12 residents of a County Durham care home have now died after displaying symptoms of coronavirus. In other developments: Have you been affected by the coronavirus?

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-52212579,What were the most-played songs of the 2010s?,"Aah, the 2010s... Do you remember them? Back in that golden age when we were all still able to listen to music in bars, cafes, shops, stadiums, at the gym and (sometimes) even at the office. Now with the first Easter of the 2020s on lockdown, PPL and BBC Radio 2 can reveal the top 40 most-played songs on UK TV and radio, of the last decade. DJ Scott Mills will countdown the list of absolute bangers - led by Adele and Bruno Mars, with three appearances each - on the station on Monday. The top 40 most-played songs are the sounds that radio producers and broadcasters have consistently played throughout the last decade and will evoke many memories for all of us, said Peter Leathem, boss of the music licensing company which compiled the chart. Jeff Smith, head of music at Radio 2, added it's packed with universally loved, sing-along pop hits that really do stand the test of time. The new data suggests broadcasters mostly favoured songs by male solo artists, with 22 nods compared to 14 solo female tracks, while American stars outweighed home-grown performers by 18-14. Bands and groups accounted for 12 of the tracks, while that most modern phenomenon of the collab yielded seven hits. And British outlets, it seems, also preferred to give airtime to songs released that decade (34 out of 40), with just a few from the noughties and Natalie Imbruglia flying the flag for the 1990s on her own, with Torn. Rihanna, Coldplay, Lady Gaga and Katy Perry all made the top 40, however that's the last you'll be hearing of that lot in this article. Because we're about to dip straight into the top 10, which features two Brits, two women and two Pharrells. The top 10 most-played songs of the 2010s on UK TV and radio: End of Youtube post by kingsofleonVEVO First up, pop pickers, is a song that you've almost certainly heard a wedding covers band butcher since its release in 2008. It gave the Nashville guitar slingers their first UK number one, and their first Grammy win too, for best rock performance by a group. In 2017, they told Radio X how they would one day explain the song's saucy lyrical content to their kids. It's Socks on Fire, said drummer Nathan Followill. Uncle Caleb's socks caught on fire one night when I was drying them out on the heater. Use Somebody, another track off their fourth album, Only by the Night, also made the top 40. End of Youtube post by CeeLo Green As many of you will have noticed, this is actually the broadcast-friendly version of the Atlanta singer's 2010 track, written in collaboration with Bruno Mars and several others. The song, which was a dig at the music industry, ironically won him a Grammy award for best urban/alternative performance. Billboard reviewed it at the time as sounding as sunny as a '60s Motown hit and as expletive-laden as an early Eminem song. CeeLo was last seen, or heard rather, performing as the monster on the surreal ITV show The Masked Singer. End of Youtube post by OneRepublicVEVO The US pop-rock band topped the UK charts for the first time in 2013 with Counting Stars, which frontman and songwriter Ryan Tedder penned when he was trying to come up with something for Beyonce (who is notably absent from this chart). The song's accompanying video has now been viewed well over 2.9 billion times on YouTube, making it the streaming site's 14th most-viewed video ever. Not enough music videos contain crocodiles these days, do they? End of Youtube post by MarkRonsonVEVO The second biggest-selling song of the decade - on streaming and physical sales - is also the second big royalty cheque on this list for the Mars man, and gives us our first Brit too. London-born US producer/DJ Ronson, and the Hawaiian singer bagged the Brit award for best British single for Uptown Funk in 2015, when it felt like it was never off the speakers, anywhere. Fun fact: after its release though, they were legally made to credit The Gap Band as co-writers, due to the song's resemblance to the their 1979 party hit, Oops Up Side Your Head. Bruno's other songs, Locked out of Heaven, and Just the Way You Are, also appear on the top 40. End of Youtube post by BlackEyedPeasVEVO Tonight's the night / Let's live it up sang B.E.P in their 2009 hit, and I'm sure we all intend to follow that advice if we're ever allowed out again. The track was produced by superstar French DJ David Guetta and arguably saw them both at the peak of their powers. After singer Fergie left in 2015, the band went on to perform the song as part of a medley before the 2017 Champions League Final in Cardiff. However, the performance, which included fireworks, ran over time and forced the kick-off to be delayed by several minutes. Fair to say they've had better nights. End of Youtube post by justintimberlakeVEVO As well as singing the film Trolls' lead song, JT played the worrywart Branch in the DreamWorks animation. In an interview with TheWrap, he said, like his character, he was pulling his hair out over the prospect of producing a hit for some colourful mythical creatures. This wasn't just like writing a song for a movie - it was writing a song for characters that are going to sing it in the movie, he said. That part had to work, and that's the part that made it a task that none of us had ever done. He needn't have worried, as the song - which he debuted live at the Eurovision song contest - won the Grammy Award for best song written for visual media. Having been released in 2016, this is actually the most recent track in the top 10, which is weighted in favour of older songs - because its surveying plays over a whole decade - and perhaps helps to solve the mystery of the missing Ed. Sheeran's stellar 2017 track, Shape of You, came in in 38th. End of Youtube post by DaftPunkVEVO Combining the musical might of the French electronic duo, the US hip-hop star and the legendary guitarist, it was only ever going to end one way, wasn't it? Choon. Stevie Wonder even added to the talent pool by joining them on-stage to perform the modern disco-hit at the 2014 Grammys, where it won record of the year and best pop group performance. It topped almost every chart in the world, selling a million equivalent copies in the UK in just 69 days. When I think how it happened, too, with people who I like a lot, that we just decided to go into the studio and do something, Rodgers told the Official Chart Company. And then it turns out like this? It's absolutely remarkable, because no-one was prepared for this! While attempting to Get Lucky is very much against current government guidelines, dancing around your kitchen to that funky bass-line is not. End of Youtube post by Maroon5VEVO Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine attempted to brighten up one of the dullest Super Bowls in recent history by going topless as sang this ode to his hip-thrusting abilities, last year in Atlanta. The 2010 track peaked at number two in the UK but topped the US charts, meaning Christina Aguilera became only the fifth female to score number one singles in three different decades, after Janet Jackson, Madonna, Spears and Cher. But it still wasn't enough for her to get invited back to the greatest show on earth to perform. Incidentally, last year, Sir Mick Jagger - the 76-year-old Rolling Stone referenced in the song's title - posted a video of himself dancing at home following heart surgery, to prove he still had his signature moves. The Los Angeles band's other big hit of the decade, Payphone - featuring rapper Wiz Khalifa - also gets a mention in the top 40. End of Youtube post by AdeleVEVO The opener from Adele's Brit award-winning second album, 21, was essentially her big comeback track following the breakthrough success of her debut, and also the moment she became a real star in the States too. The gospel-tinged vibes of the pounding 2010 track saw her pick up three Grammys - record and song of the year, plus best short-form music video. The visuals found her alone in an abandoned room which soon began to fall apart, like the relationship she was singing about. After Mark Ronson, the Londoner is the only other British-born artist (and second woman) to appear in the top 10... and he mostly grew up in New York. Someone Like You and Set Fire to the Rain, from the same blockbuster album, also made the top 40 mix. End of Youtube post by PharrellWilliamsVEVO So there you have it! An upbeat and inoffensive top 10. The appearance of Mr Williams' second ubiquitous earworm of the 2010s confirms there is no room at all at the top table for Drake, Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber or Ariana Grande. Possibly as while they are popular with younger audiences, radio and TV has to appeal to a much broader listenership. Happy was another track written for an animated film; namely Despicable Me 2, and it fast became the eighth biggest-selling song in UK chart history. A live rendition of the song eventually scored the singer/rapper a Grammy, after he previously lost out in the best original song category to Let it Go, from Disney's Frozen. When they read the results, my face was... frozen, Pharrell told GQ magazine. But then I thought about it, and I just decided just to... let it go. With Lucky and Happy enjoying great success, we look forward to seeing which of the remaining seven dwarves he'll name his hits after in this new era. (Joke... we know Lucky isn't one really).

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52205655,Coronavirus: Body-bag stocks 'in danger of running out',"Mortuary suppliers have told BBC News they have no stocks of standard body bags left for sale, blaming the shortage on stockpiling due to the coronavirus pandemic. New stocks from overseas cannot be sourced for many weeks, they say. The NHS says it currently has adequate stocks but health workers report having to wrap bodies in sheets. Public Health England said the virus that caused Covid-19 degraded quickly after a patient had died. And there was no specific need for body bags to be used to transport these corpses, although there may be other practical reasons for their use. Barber Medical, which has the NHS contract for mortuary supplies, said availability of zipped mortuary bags was a real problem and they could not be sourced anywhere. The company has, however, increased the availability of polythene bags, known as body pouch bags, and urged any hospital or trust struggling with supplies to contact it. A major supplier to undertakers also told BBC News it could not get hold of body bags, because of stockpiling. NHS trusts and funeral directors were desperate for the bags and horrified by the official advice it was safe not to use them, it said. The bags it sells are made in China but it said it took six weeks to ship them to the UK and air freighting them was prohibitively expensive. The company has looked into making its own bags but cannot source the required plastic fibre. The supplier also said it was unable to keep up with the desperate demand from funeral directors for personal protective equipment (PPE) and the whole industry was worried about how to cope with current death rates. William Quail, managing director of mortuary supplies firm Mortuary Equipment Direct, has hired a team of people to sew between 150 and 200 body bags a day, but he said he was struggling to get the products to hospitals due to bureaucracy. He said at £57.50 the bags were more expensive than those made in China, which he said cost £9. Dignity is the word, Mr Quail said. I don't think £57 would seem very much if it was your mother or father. I understand they are more expensive but what is a body worth to treat it with respect. On Monday, Sally Goodright, a nurse in a west London hospital, wrote on Facebook, in a post later removed: We ran out of body bags but still the dead were arriving from the wards. The GMB union says some porters have been told to transport the bodies of patients in sheets. Helen O'Connor, a regional organiser at Epsom and St Helier NHS Trust, said: We are extremely concerned about the psychological and physical wellbeing of our hospital members who are traumatised and struggling to cope with the impact of this pandemic. They are on the front line, doing the type of work that would distress anyone and increasingly dealing with death. A spokeswoman for the trust denied there was a shortage - but did not dispute sheets were being used to wrap bodies, saying there were plenty of zippered body bags to get the hospital trust through the current period but under Public Health England guidance they were not always necessary. The guidance says: Body bags are not deemed necessary but may be used for other practical reasons. Placing a cloth or mask over the mouth of the deceased when moving them can help to prevent the release of aerosols. BBC News also received a report from a worker at Watford General Hospital who said bedsheets were being used to wrap the dead. When the West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust was asked if using bedsheets was appropriate, it responded: We're wrapping bodies in line with national procedures. BBC News understands an emergency stock of thousands of body bags held by emergency services will be made available to hospitals and funeral directors. An NHS Supply Chain spokeswoman said it had an adequate stock of body bags and was expecting more to arrive soon. Industry body the British Plastics Federation said UK plastics companies were stepping in to help provide equipment in high demand - but it had not received any requests for body bags."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-52269398,"Coronavirus: Army veteran, 99, 'smashes' £500k NHS target","A 99-year-old army veteran who has joined the fundraising fight against Covid-19 has smashed his £500,000 target. Tom Moore aims to complete 100 laps of his Bedfordshire garden by Thursday, walking with the aid of a frame. He originally hoped to raise £1,000 for NHS Charities Together, to thank magnificent staff after recent treatment for a broken hip and cancer. He said: I thank the British public from the bottom of my heart. Who would have thought that when I set a target of £1,000 a week ago, it could have reached £500,000? he added. More than 24,000 people have contributed funds; he has appeared on TV; and singer and actor Jason Donovan has tweeted him birthday wishes. Mr Moore has completed 70 laps of the 25-metre (82ft) loop in his garden in Marston Moretaine, and is taking them on in 10-lap chunks. However, with the hot weather over the weekend, he decided to do 10 laps over two days to pace himself. He is still ahead of schedule and hopes to complete the 2.5km (1.6 miles) distance by Thursday, instead of his initial target of his 100th birthday on 30 April. Mr Moore was born in Keighley, West Yorkshire, and trained as a civil engineer before enlisting in the army for World War Two, rising to captain and serving in India and Burma. Mr Moore's daughter, Hannah, said when she told him he had reached £500,000 there was stunned silence. We are completely floored by the amount of support flooding in - it's just incredible and he is smashing his target, she said. We say he needs a rest but he says that so long as he is slow and steady, he will reach it. A 100th birthday party with 100 guests has had to be cancelled due to the coronavirus restrictions. But when a 1940s-style singer booked to attend serenaded him online, he was able to join in.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52199185,Coronavirus: What's happening to the beer left in pubs?,"Pubs, like other public venues, look set to stay shut for the foreseeable future. But what's going to happen to the contents of their cellars? Fifty million pints - give or take. That's the amount of beer expected to go unused in barrels if pubs remain closed into the summer because of coronavirus. Publicans are currently unable to sell their lagers, ales and ciders - save for takeaways and home deliveries. It's a very sad waste of all the work and talent that goes into producing great beer, says Tom Stainer, chief executive of the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra). People won't get to drink it and all those resources have been used up for nothing. Mr Stainer estimates the UK's 39,000 pubs have, on average, 15 barrels in their cellar at any given time. Most are kegs containing 11 gallons (88 pints) each - although many real ales come in nine-gallon (72-pint) casks. The best-before dates on pasteurised beer - including most lagers - are usually three to four months after delivery. Those for real ales and other unpasteurised beer are usually set at six to nine weeks. So most stock could go to waste if social distancing measures remain in place for several months. Keris De Villiers, landlady of the Ram Inn, the Old Sergeant and the Pig and Whistle in Wandsworth, south-west London, says barrelled beer worth about £10,000 could go off in her cellars - while 1,000 litres (1,760 pints) more beer remains in vats at the SlyBeast microbrewery she and husband Lee have recently set up. We could do takeaways, she says, but that would mean selling beer on the corner of a very small pavement. That wouldn't be socially responsible, with the need for people to keep their distance from one another. The whole situation is heart-breaking. Our brewer literally talks to his tanks when he's at work every day. People really care about the beer they're making. It's a craft and people are passionate about it. Supermarket alcohol sales increased by more than a fifth last month as pubs - along with cafes and restaurants - closed on 20 March. People are missing these things in their lives, says Mr Stainer. It's not the biggest issue that the country is dealing with, but aspects of life like going to the cinema or cafe, or going for a pint, are something we treasure. Many breweries and distributors have offered to take back barrels at no charge once the lockdown is over, taking some of the financial pressure off landlords. Iain Crockett, director of Gloucestershire-based Severn Brewing, says draymen - people who deliver beer - face the worst week of their lives when the pub trade returns, having to lift full barrels - rather than empties - out of cellars. He wants there to be at least a couple of weeks' notice before pubs are allowed to reopen. All the little brewers are going to be completely shafted otherwise, Mr Crockett says. While the big brewers have large storage capacities, small operators will be starting more from scratch, he adds. Before that, though, there's the question of how to get rid of tens of millions of pints. Can we expect scenes like those following the introduction of Prohibition in the US a century ago, where bottles and barrels were smashed, their contents poured away? Probably not. In the US, bar owners have been told not to tip out-of-date beer down storm drains, because it's illegal and environmentally damaging. Some UK publicans, have, however, already resorted to this. The British Institute of Innkeeping is advising against such action, amid concern it could leave landlords further out of pocket. Under Treasury rules, when publicans get rid of large amounts of spoilt beer, duty doesn't need to be paid on it. Brewery representatives normally oversee this process, but because of social distancing they can't visit premises at the moment. The government has temporarily allowed brewers to appoint publicans to oversee the dumping of beer. But they must keep a proper record of it, including perhaps filming a video as proof it's been destroyed, rather than put aside for profit. One option that publicans and brewers who spoke to the BBC would love to try is converting out-of-date beer into hand sanitiser, by extracting the alcohol. Independent brewer Brewdog is already making hand sanitiser at its Aberdeenshire premises, while the government is giving manufacturers who want to do the same priority access to the methylated spirits - or denatured alcohol - they need. Despite these difficult times, Mrs De Villiers says pub owners and tenants are doing all we can to survive and assist the community. The breweries are helping us and they want us to survive, she adds. Everyone's ready to help everyone else. In an effort to limit the economic damage caused by coronavirus, the government has offered £330bn in loans, £20bn in other aid, a business rates holiday, and grants for retailers and pubs. Pubs are at the heart of our communities and an important part of local economies, says a spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. We've asked them to temporarily close in order to help protect people and reduce the spread of the virus. But we are also delivering support to help businesses, including pubs, through the coronavirus pandemic."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52236388,Coronavirus: What Boris Johnson's Greek hero teaches us about epidemics,"As Boris Johnson recovers from Covid-19, he will undoubtedly be thinking of an earlier epidemic, says Oxford classicist Armand D'Angour - the plague that hit Athens in 430 BC, and killed the prime minister's hero, Pericles. It's an episode, D'Angour argues, that holds many lessons for today. Britain's Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, is well versed in the history and culture of ancient Greece. He knows that Western literature begins with a plague, the epidemic described in the opening book of Homer's Iliad - of which Boris can happily declaim scores of verses from memory. And his political hero has long been the ancient Athenian leader, Pericles, whose bust sits in his office in 10 Downing Street. The prime minister has often quoted admiringly the stirring oration given by Pericles to honour the dead after the first year of a destructive war against Sparta. And he will be well aware that Pericles gave a second famous speech a year later, after a devastating plague, probably a form of typhus, had killed around one third of Athens' citizens. Both orations were reported by the contemporary historian Thucydides, whose searing description of the Great Plague is worth reading for its literary virtuosity alone. Commentators today have drawn parallels between the responses of Athenians - ranging from the heroic to the contemptible - and those of valiant NHS staff and scared panic-buyers today. But surprisingly, none has drawn attention to the lesson Thucydides himself intended. What doesn't change, wrote the historian, is human nature; you can expect people to react in similar ways when they encounter events like those that have occurred in the past. He embarked on his work, he says, because a clear grasp of the events he was living through could guide responses to similar events in future. He modelled his method on that of the most innovative medical practitioner of the day, the physician Hippocrates. Rather than prescribing prayers and religious rituals, spells and incantations, or exotic herbs and quack remedies, Hippocrates and his contemporaries were visiting sick patients, meticulously noting their symptoms, and keeping track of how they responded to prescribed treatments such as sleep, exercise, and the regulation of diet. Boris Johnson was a patient at St Thomas' hospital, and is likely to have been participating in a medical trial that compares treatments for Covid-19 - so it may be that Hippocrates will come to his mind, as well as Pericles and Thucydides. One of the worst aspects of the plague was the despair into which people fell on finding they had the disease. Those who were convinced they had no hope were much quicker to give up and die, observed Thucydides. Another was the rate of infection among those who flocked to care for and doctor to others: they died in droves, and had the highest incidence of mortality… In addition, the plague led to greater crime, since criminals calculated on escaping detection and penalties. What might we learn from these observations? First, that people should avoid becoming infected by close contact, and that medical staff and carers should be protected. Secondly, that the law must continue to function robustly. And thirdly, that it is important for people to preserve a positive state of mind. Measures to achieve these aims have been, if in some cases belatedly, widely pursued in the UK and elsewhere. The Athenians survived the plague of 430 BC with astonishing resilience. Just 15 years later they were able to muster a huge military and naval force to mount an offensive expedition overseas. But when the plague struck, Athens had only recently gone to war, and a large contingent of troops had been sent north to pursue hostilities. Sadly, they took the disease with them, and over 1,000 men died from it. One of the soldiers serving on the campaign was the philosopher, Socrates. Not only did he survive infection, allegedly thanks to his physical toughness and discipline, but on return to his plague-ridden city he was said to have tended unscathed to the sick and dying. Socrates had evidently acquired immunity from his earlier exposure to the disease, just as Thucydides himself, who had survived infection, recognised that this made him immune from reinfection. It was to be thousands of years before medical immunity was properly understood, but the historian implies that historical hindsight can itself be a kind of vaccine. History need not simply recall the horrors of the past. It can guide us towards adopting precautions, remind us that accurate observation is vital to ensure a better response in future, and reassure us that normal life will one day return. Meanwhile, we should also remember that history never repeats itself exactly, even if it can offer valuable lessons for posterity. Pericles had been the leading citizen in Athens for over three decades before his death from the plague at the age of 66. Until that day his luck had held to a remarkable degree. He had been admired and bitterly reviled, had fought military campaigns and faced legal trials, and had survived accusations of corruption and sexual misconduct. In his 50s he entered into a passionate and enduring relationship with the brilliant young Aspasia of Miletus, who bore him a child and helped him compose his magnificent funeral oration to the war dead. Britain's prime minister is 55. He has faced stern challenges, has experienced failure as well and success, and has benefited greatly from luck, no less than political skill. When, as is hoped, he makes a full recovery from Covid-19, perhaps busts of the historian Thucydides, the physician Hippocrates, and the philosopher Socrates, should join that of Pericles on his mantelpiece in No.10 Downing Street. Prof Armand D'Angour, the author of Socrates in Love: The making of a philosopher, wrote the Greek ode that Boris Johnson recited at the opening gala of the London Olympics in 2012 In these dark days of Covid-19 some practices have remained timeless - the use of soap, scrubbing and fresh air. Other advice on infectious diseases given my grandfather Dr John Davy Rolleston in 1940 sounds, well, from a bygone era. Does my grandfather's 1940 infectious disease advice still hold true?"
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-52267943,Coronavirus: Five ways the outbreak is hitting global food industry,"As the world's population was plunged into lockdown, our social media feeds became filled with stories of shortages at local supermarkets. But with many restaurants and other areas of the hospitality industry effectively shut for business, food producers are warning they actually have too much stock which will now go to waste. These are some of the ways the coronavirus pandemic is impacting the supply chain of food around the world. With coffee shops closed completely in some countries, oversupply of milk is emerging as a real side-effect of the pandemic. Dairy Farmers of America, the country's biggest dairy co-operative, is estimating that farmers are having to dump 3.7 million gallons (14 million litres) of milk every single day because of disrupted supply routes. This issue is not only being seen in the US, with dairy farmers in the UK asking for government help because of their own surplus problems. Peter Alvis, chair of the Royal Association of British Dairy Farmers, says about five million litres per week are at risk. He warned farmers receiving reduced value for their output or having to dump their excess are faced with severe economic repercussions amid already tight margins. Closures are impacting all areas of agriculture. Some producers have tried to pivot to supplying ordinary shoppers, but changed market demand and excess stock remains a problem across the sector. The New York Times, which interviewed some US producers, cited an example of one chicken processor having to smash 750,000 unhatched eggs every single week. They also spoke to an onion farmer who was having to let most of his harvest decompose, unable to re-distribute his onions in high enough qualities and without the facilities to store them. In India, tea planters are warning that lockdown measures have already caused the first wave of their precious Darjeeling crop to go to waste and there are fears for the second. On top of oversupply and the difficulty in pivoting toward retail consumers, farmers in a lot of places are also encountering problems because of staffing shortages. Self-isolation and social distancing guidelines are reportedly slowing picking efforts in places, and national lockdowns are disrupting the usual international flow of labour across the industry. Last week Germany made an exception to its country's lockdown to allow thousands of Romanian and Polish workers to fly in to help with the spring harvest, especially with picking strawberries and asparagus. There has also been a 'Feed the Nation' campaign launched in the UK to encourage domestic workers to plug any labour gaps to avoid food waste. The pandemic has led to some changes in what we are trying to buy. For example, the UK has seen demand for flour soar in recent weeks as people stuck at home increasingly turn to home-baking. According to new data, cited by BFMTV, French shoppers have increasingly been buying more organic food since coronavirus fears took hold of the country. This could be because they are shopping at smaller, local stores - experts say - or because people want to eat more healthy and local food during the outbreak. The revelation comes as France's minister for agriculture called on local officials to promote the re-opening of food markets across the country. They were previously ordered shut over safety concerns, but have been gradually returning with guarantees that social distancing rules are in place. Take UK pub closures for example. Much of the industry's current supply of lager and ale could now go to waste under government rules which mean they could be closed for the foreseeable future. Some beers have a best-before date of just weeks - which means thousands of unused barrels in pub basements could be undrinkable by the time the lockdown is lifted. People in the industry warn this could mean large financial losses for businesses. Some parts of the food industry are benefiting from our changing consumption habits. US sales of orange juice, which had been on a gradual decline, are said to be up 38% on last year's figures. The so-called futures price of orange juice has soared in recent weeks. The Covid-19 outbreaks are hitting both the supply and demand for orange juice, Stephen Innes, chief global market strategist at broker AxiCorp said last month. The immune-boosting properties are the demand-side attraction while there are simply not enough tanker spaces, with airlines not flying, to bring the product to markets. The demand is good news for orange growers, especially in Florida and Brazil - who supply big brands like Tropicana."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52268341,Coronavirus: New Zealand nurse who treated Boris Johnson says it was 'surreal',"A New Zealand nurse praised by Boris Johnson for helping to save his life said treating the prime minister was the most surreal time in her life, her parents have said. Jenny McGee, along with Luis Pitarma from Portugal, was praised by the PM for standing at his bedside when things could have gone either way. Ms McGee's parents told Television New Zealand they are exceptionally proud. They said she treated Mr Johnson like any other patient. Mr Johnson was discharged from St Thomas' Hospital in London on Sunday, one week after being admitted to be treated for coronavirus. He spent several nights in the intensive care unit where he was given oxygen. He said the NHS has saved my life, no question and paid tribute to many medics, singling out Ms McGee and Mr Pitarma specifically. Ms McGee's parents said they knew Mr Johnson was in the hospital their daughter works in as it was all over the news. But our daughter's very professional so we don't ask things or she doesn't spill things. It really wasn't until he was out of intensive care until she actually told us, her mother Caroline told TVNZ. She said she had just had a most surreal time in her life, something she will never forget. And that she had been taking care of Boris. She added: It makes us feel exceptionally proud, obviously. But she has told us these things over the years and it doesn't matter what patient she's looking after, this is what she does and I just find it incredible that she, any nurses, can do this for 12 hours. Sit and watch a patient, and twiddle away with all the different knobs to keep their patients alive. It's absolutely amazing. Her brother Rob said that when he spoke to her she was on her way to work to do another night shift. He told the New Zealand Herald: We are all very proud of Jen, not just in the support she gave Boris - but what she has been doing helping everyday people. Whilst she is blown away by Boris's recognition, she is just really pleased to see the public recognition for the amazing work the NHS is doing - that made her really proud. Ms McGee is from Invercargill, on New Zealand's South Island. The mayor of the city Sir Tim Shadbolt told Stuff.co.nz: It's not very often a nurse from Invercargill saves the life of the British prime minister. Meanwhile, her former school Verdon College paid tribute to her courage, adding she had wanted to be a nurse since leaving school in 2002. Jenny is described by her past teachers as an absolutely delightful person and someone who had a caring and humble nature, the college said in a statement. The second nurse mentioned by Mr Johnson has been named as Luis Pitarma. According to the Expresso, Mr Pitarma, 29, is from Aveiro in Portugal and moved to London six years ago. He studied nursing in Lisbon. It added that he first worked at the Luton and Dunstable University Hospital for two years before moving to St Thomas'. The president of Portugal, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, has personally thanked Mr Pitarma, as well as the commitment of all Portuguese health professionals who in Portugal and around the world are providing decisive help in the fight to the pandemic. On Monday, No 10 confirmed Mr Johnson had left hospital after being given the all clear by medics. He will continue recovering at Chequers, the prime minister's official country residence, as it was considered to be a suitable place and he will not be carrying out government work, the spokesman said. Aides are reportedly expecting Mr Johnson to be out of action for up to a month while he recovers. Mr Johnson spoke to Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab - who is currently in charge of running the government - over the weekend, No 10 added. Speaking in a video posted after he left hospital, Mr Johnson, 55, said it was hard to find words to express my debt to the health service. He thanked many nurses by name before adding: I hope they won't mind if I mention in particular two nurses who stood by my bedside for 48 hours when things could have gone either way. They're Jenny from New Zealand. And Luis from Portugal near Porto. The reason in the end my body did start to get enough oxygen was because for every second of the night they were watching and they were thinking and they were caring and making the interventions I needed. Around one in eight NHS workers - 13.1% of the workforce, or 153,000 staff - are not British, according to a parliamentary report published in July last year. After British, the most common nationalities of NHS staff are Indian with around 21,000 workers, followed by Filipino, Irish, Polish and then Portuguese staff. On Sunday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock paid tribute to everyone who has joined the NHS from all over the world."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-52268441,"Tim Brooke-Taylor: Cleese, Fry and more pay tribute to comedy 'hero'","John Cleese, Stephen Fry and David Mitchell have paid tribute to wonderful comedian Tim Brooke-Taylor after his death at the age of 79. Cleese, who co-starred with Brooke-Taylor in the 1960s and 70s, said he was a great performer and companion. Fry described him as a hero for as long as I can remember, while Mitchell said the world has been robbed. The former member of 1970s trio The Goodies died on Sunday after contracting coronavirus. Cleese, who met the comedian at Cambridge University and went on to appear with him on stage and screen, said the news meant he had just lost the will to be silly. Fry added that Brooke-Taylor was gentle, kind, funny, wise, warm, but piercingly witty when he chose to be. Mitchell, who appeared alongside Brooke-Taylor on BBC Radio 4's panel show I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue, described him as a wonderful comedian and a really lovely man. The surviving members of The Goodies mourned their co-star. Bill Oddie remembered him as a true visual comic and a great friend, while Graeme Garden said he was terribly saddened by the loss of a dear colleague and close friend of over 50 years. The madcap sketch show began in 1970 and ran for 12 years, bringing the trio prime-time TV success. Brooke-Taylor had previously starred with Garden, Oddie and Cleese, among others, on BBC radio comedy I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again in the 1960s. That later led to Radio 4's long-running I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue. Brooke-Taylor appeared on the first edition in 1972 and remained a regular guest. The show's host Jack Dee said Brooke-Taylor was a delightful man and never anything but great company. He said: Tim brought a unique quality to Clue. He was a proper team player, very generous as a performer, never egotistical and always more than delighted to set himself up as the butt of the joke. For me, his great comedy gift was playing the injured innocent and he did it with brilliance and a characteristic lightness of touch. It's always heartbreaking to lose a loved one, but these times have created the cruellest of circumstances for that to happen in and my thoughts are with his wife Christine and all his family. One of his biggest contributions to British comedy was co-writing and performing the famous Four Yorkshiremen sketch with John Cleese, Chapman and Marty Feldman, originally for the ITV comedy programme At Last The 1948 Show!

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-52268447,"Coronavirus: Theatres need bailout to survive, warns writer James Graham","Playwright James Graham has said an aggressive government bailout is needed to save theatres from the impact of the coronavirus crisis. UK venues have been shut for four weeks, with all West End performances cancelled until at least 31 May. In several months' time, all of the reserves will have dried up and there will be no money left, Graham warned. I don't even know if there will be a theatre or film industry that we can recognise when this is all over. Graham, one of the country's leading dramatists, has turned his hit West End play Quiz, about the Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? coughing scandal, into an ITV mini-series. While some theatres have started streaming online, he told the PA news agency it was a collective artform. He explained: You need people around you to see it and do it and there is no middle ground now. If it's going to survive in any form it will need an aggressive government bailout and you either do or you don't do it. There is either theatre or there isn't any more. So there is kind of a clarity to what we need to ask government to do for it to survive and hopefully they will do it. Graham's stage credits also include This House, Ink and Labour of Love, and he penned the TV dramas Brexit: The Uncivil War and Coalition. I am already exhausted about the scale of the fight ahead because every industry, every small business, are all in the same situation and it's obviously very upsetting, he said. But because the theatres were the first to close... probably, because of the very nature of what they are, gathering people together in close proximity, they will be close to being the last buildings to reopen. Sir Andrew Lloyd-Webber recently said he does not expect theatres to reopen until the end of September. Graham continued: I am worried that to have the political argument to justify that level of arts investment again at a time when the economy will be devastated, that's difficult. I'm worried for what kind of work, what kind of artists, what kind of people, in a more dangerous climate, will be allowed to make the work. I think the default naturally goes to safety, rather than invention. I say this as a playwright who comes from a working-class background - working-class actors and artists might be the ones who struggle to find themselves back on those platforms and in those spaces. A spokesman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: We are committed to supporting our theatres during this national emergency with help available through the government's unprecedented financial package for business, workers and the self-employed. We are in regular contact with the arts and culture sector as we work on our ongoing coronavirus response which includes considering further action that may be necessary.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52242856,Coronavirus: Remembering the NHS workers who have died,"A midwife originally from Hong Kong. A hospital cleaner who became a nurse. A retired village GP who carried on caring for his former patients. Thousands of people in the UK have now died with coronavirus, including doctors, nurses, surgeons and other NHS workers. Tens of NHS workers are known to have died so far, with doctors who came out of retirement among those who have lost their lives. Here are some of their stories. The mother of four was a matron at Hillingdon Hospital, where she cared for older patients with mental health problems and dementia. On Saturday, the trust confirmed her death at Watford General Hospital. Her husband, Gary, said she was devoted to her family - to her daughters, Gemma and Freya, and twin sons, Kyle and Michael. Sara had that unbeatable combination of kindness, selflessness and total determination to get things right for patients, colleague Dr Paul Hopper added. Ms Campbell, a mother of two, was a treasured member of staff who could light up a room with her infectious laugh and bubbly personality, colleagues said. She was often found singing and dancing, entertaining patients and staff, making everyone smile, they added. Ms Campbell was a healthcare support worker who worked at the Velindre Cancer Centre, in Cardiff. She died at the University Hospital Wales in Cardiff on 10 April. Colleagues said the nurse, who was originally from the Philippines and worked at Hammersmith Hospital, in west London, loved his NHS job. Last month, he changed his Facebook profile picture to an image of him wearing a protective mask emblazoned with the words: I can't stay at home, I'm a healthcare worker. He died after going into self-isolation with coronavirus symptoms, a friend and fellow nurse said. The grandmother, who worked at Royal Liverpool University Hospital, was an unsung hero, her local NHS trust said. Her job was to make arrangements to allow patients to safely leave hospital, having spent most of her career as a care worker for people with disabilities. Barbara was a much-loved wife, mum, nan, sister, auntie, friend and beautiful person, her family said. She loved nothing more than spending precious time with her family. A grandfather, Gareth Roberts had worked as a nurse at sites across the Cardiff and Vale health board since the 1980s. He had retired in December 2014 before returning to work in January 2015. He was extremely popular, fun-filled and well-liked, the board said while staff said he was a kind and helpful person. Mr Roberts died at the Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil. Julie Omar had been working as a sister on Ward 14 at the Alexandra Hospital in Redditch, and had also previously worked with the trauma team at Worcestershire Royal Hospital. She was a much-loved member of its nursing team, said the Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, and a dedicated and highly experienced trauma and orthopaedics nurse. She died at home on 10 April, and leaves a husband, Laith, and a grown-up daughter. A married father-of-two, Dr Chowdhury was a consultant urologist at Homerton University Hospital, in east London. His son Intisar described the consultant urologist as a kind and compassionate hero who had been in such pain when he wrote an appeal to the government on Facebook, warning about a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) for NHS workers. He wrote that post while he was in that state, just because of how much he cared about his co-workers, his son said. Family friend and fellow doctor Golam Rahat Khan said Dr Chowdhury liked singing, and enjoyed celebrating Bengali and English culture and heritage. He was so caring, he would call us very often to come to his house, he added. Dr Chowdhury died on 8 April. Dr Edmond Adedeji worked as a locum registrar in the emergency department of Great Western Hospital in Swindon, Wiltshire. He died doing a job he loved, serving others before himself, his family said in a statement. The hospital's chief executive added he was a respected and well-liked member of the team. Dr Adedeji died on 8 April. Ms Ong loved her job, her daughter Melissa told the PA news agency. She said her mother came to London from Hong Kong in the 1970s to join the NHS because she believed it was the best in the world. Ms Ong began her career as a midwife and was working full-time at two surgeries and holding baby clinics before falling ill. She died on 7 April. Sister Leilani Dayrit died of suspected coronavirus after displaying symptoms at work, her daughter has said. Mary Dayrit, 19, said her mother had been selfless until the very end and put other people's wellbeing before her own. She had asthma, and had been self-isolating at home for seven days before she died on 7 April. She had stopped breathing and paramedics were unable to revive her. Mary said her mother was a compassionate woman who made sure to spread joy, happiness and love to anyone that ever needed it. Ms Graham was the first NHS worker in Scotland to die from coronavirus. My Mum was there for me no matter what. I will miss everything about her, her son told STV News. A healthcare support worker and district nurse, Ms Graham died at Inverclyde Royal Hospital on 6 April. Our father was a selfless and compassionate doctor for over 50 years, Dr Haider's daughter told the BBC after the death of the GP, who served as a senior partner at Valance Medical Centre, in Dagenham, east London. His dedication to help people everywhere, be it professionally or personally was unwavering. We are truly astounded as to how many people have reached out to share a story of his kindness, and continue to receive touching tributes from colleagues, patients, friends and family alike, Samina Haider said. Dr Haider, who died on 6 April, also worked for more than 30 years as a senior homeopathic physician at the Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine. Ms O'Rourke was such a kind and caring nurse who had a really special relationship with her patients and colleagues, said the ward manager of the acute medical unit she worked in. Nursing was something she had always wanted to do, although she came to it relatively late after raising her girls. The 39-year-old died at the hospital where she worked - the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Hospital, in Margate, Kent - on 2 April. Ms Nasreen worked as a hospital cleaner before gaining her nursing qualification in 2019. She died on 2 April at Walsall Manor Hospital, in the West Midlands - the hospital she had worked at for 16 years. We've lost an amazing nurse, but we've lost also an amazing person in life, her sister Kazeema Nasreen said. The chief executive of Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust said Ms Nasreen always said she was so blessed to have the role of a nurse, which she absolutely loved because she wanted to feel like she could make a difference - and you did, Areema, you will be very sadly missed. The grandmother followed her dream and trained as a midwife in later life, her family said in a statement. She was a very well-respected midwife who supported many hundreds of women as they welcomed their babies into the world, they added. Ms Coventry had worked at the Princess Alexandra Hospital, in Harlow, Essex, for 10 years. She died on 2 April. Ms Sharma, who worked as a pharmacist at Eastbourne District General Hospital, was the superstar of the family, her brother said. Her irresistible laugh, sense of humour and good nature would light up our world and fill it with colours. For this I am eternally grateful that Pooja was my sister. For me, Pooja would always be the little protector or shield for when I had done something mischievous and she would cover for me with my parents. Dr Ayache stopped working a month before he died, but his family say they think he continued to visit patients in their homes in an effort to help. The retired GP, who worked for the NHS in Suffolk for more than 40 years, would often pop round and just check [former patients] were OK, his daughter Layla Ayache said. He was a rural village GP at heart, she added. He had also helped to raise money for refugee charities to help people in Syria, where he was born. Ms Ayache said her father's entire life was split between his family and his work, adding: That was all he lived for really, was those two things. He died on 8 April. Father-of-two Jitendra Rathod was a dearly loved specialist heart surgeon at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, where he spent 25 years. The health board's chief executive said he was a great surgeon who would be missed by his colleagues. Mr Rathod died in the intensive care ward at the hospital on 6 April. The nurse had worked in the children's cancer unit at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary before taking up other roles in the health sector. She was a devoted friend, an incredible nurse and an unapologetically imperfect person, one of her friends said in a Facebook post. Ms Mack was not believed to have been directly dealing with patients before becoming ill. She died on 5 April. A healthcare assistant, Mr Corbin worked at the Park Royal Centre for Mental Health, in north-west London, for more than 25 years. He was the 'go to' person who knew everything about the ward and how to get things done, said Claire Murdoch, head of the local NHS trust, adding he was the backbone of his team. Mr Corbin died on 4 April. A published historian, Dr Sebastianpillai trained at a medical school in Sri Lanka and went on to specialise in treating elderly people at Kingston Hospital in south-west London. He was hugely respected as a consultant and author, Ed Davey, acting Lib Dem leader, said. He described the consultant geriatrician's book, A Complete Illustrated History of Sri Lanka, as world class. Dr Sebastianpillai, who was in his 70s, died on 4 April. Ms Glanister was a long-serving nurse at the Aintree University Hospital, in Liverpool. We are so proud to see just how many people's lives Liz has touched, her family said in a statement. Losing a loved one at any time is heartbreaking, but to go through it as we and many other families are is simply beyond words. Ms Glanister - pictured centre, below - died on 3 April at Royal Liverpool University Hospital. We are sorry to announce that another member of our nursing family, Liz Glanister, has sadly passed away from COVID-19. pic.twitter.com/8ncTE1ceVF End of Twitter post by @NursingNotesUK Prof Shousha was an honorary professor of histopathology at Imperial College London, and had worked at UK cancer research laboratories at London's Hammersmith and Charing Cross hospitals since 1978. He died on 2 April. Living legend Dr Alfa Saadu, who had returned to work after retirement, died in hospital on 31 March. His family said he had been working part-time at the Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital in Welwyn, Hertfordshire, before contracting the virus. His son Dani Saadu said the family suggested he should go to hospital, but his father insisted he did not want to take up a hospital bed because others would need it. Mr Saadu added: He was a very passionate man, who cared about saving people... he loved to lecture people in the world of medicine, he did so in the UK and Africa. Father-of-seven Thomas Harvey, 57, was a healthcare assistant at Goodmayes Hospital in Ilford, east London. His family criticised the NHS for the lack of personal protective equipment provided to staff, saying he just had gloves and a flimsy apron. He died at home on 29 March, after feeling unwell for several days. An ear, nose and throat consultant at the University Hospitals of Derby and Burton, Mr El-Hawrani's family said he was a loving and much-loved husband, son, father, brother, and friend. His greatest passions were his family and his profession, and he dedicated his life to both, they said. Mr El-Hawrani died at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester on 28 March. Dr Zaidi was a managing partner of a GP practice with his wife Dr Talat Zaidi. Their four children all work in the medical profession. His daughter, Dr Sarah Zaidi, said his death was reflective of his sacrifice and he had a vocational attitude to service. His colleague Dr Jose Garcia-Lobera said he had left behind an incredible legacy and was a hugely respected, selfless man who dedicated his life to helping others. Dr Zaidi died in intensive care at Southend Hospital, Essex, on 25 March. Renowned surgeon Dr El Tayar worked in the NHS for 11 years before moving back to his native Sudan to help establish a transplant programme. He returned to the UK in 2015, working as a locum surgeon before his death. He gave the precious gift of life to so many people around the world, fellow surgeon Abbas Ghazanfar wrote in a tribute. He was an excellent colleague, a truly humble soul and above all a noble human being. He died at West Middlesex University Hospital in Isleworth, west London, on 25 March."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-52270186,Sturgeon: Coronavirus lockdown 'unlikely to be lifted' soon,"Scotland's coronavirus lockdown is not likely to be lifted in the very near future, Nicola Sturgeon has said. The first minister said there were early optimistic signs that social distancing measures were having an impact on the spread of the virus. But she said that until we know more and have solid evidence, we must stick with it. She said the lockdown would not be in place for a single minute longer than necessary, but it remains essential. Interim chief medical officer Dr Gregor Smith also said the lockdown measures were expected to remain in place for a significant period of time. Ms Sturgeon said a total of 6,076 Scots had now tested positive for coronavirus, although she stressed that this would be an under-estimate and did not include figures from some local laboratories. She said there were 1,797 patients in hospital, 211 of whom are in intensive care. And a further nine people have died after testing positive for the virus, bringing the total figure to 575. However, Ms Sturgeon stressed a note of caution around the figures, as they only include hospital deaths where patients have recorded a positive test and there tends to be a reporting lag over the weekends. More detailed figures including deaths in care homes and other settings - and those where coronavirus is a suspected cause - will be released on Wednesday. By law, the UK's lockdown restrictions have to be reviewed every 21 days, and are set to be looked at this week. However, Ms Sturgeon said there was no prospect of them being lifted in the short term. She said: I want to be very clear, so nobody is under any illusions - that review is not likely to result in these restrictions being lifted in the very near future. There are early optimistic signs that the steps we are taking are working, but until we know more and have solid evidence, we must stick with it. Stressing that the stringent measures remain essential, the first minister added: They will not be in force for a single minute longer than necessary, but if we lift them too early or do so without thinking through properly how we can ease them while still keeping the virus under control, then we risk it spreading out of control, risk it overwhelming our NHS and risk it taking many more lives. The traditional Easter message is one of rebirth and renewal. The message from the Scottish government, embroiled as it is in the country's biggest crisis in decades, can't be so uplifting. Don't delay funerals was the grim theme of what the interim chief medical officer had to say. Some families, it seems, may want to delay holding a service until the government lifts strict limits of how many family and friends can attend. It underlines how the virus - and the lockdown - impact on everyone's lives. The first minister made it clear there'll be a review of restrictions this week - but they're not likely to be lifted in the very near future. The key goal, she said, was saving lives. What then of an exit strategy from the lockdown? On this too, there was caution - a need to wait and see how lifting controls might work - or backfire - in other European countries. Nicola Sturgeon said the more consistency across the UK the better, when restrictions are eased. But if Scotland has to take a different approach for practical reasons, she's happy to do so. Ms Sturgeon said we need to understand a bit more than we do now about the impact these measures have had before consideration is given to lifting them. She said that the virus may not have gone away, and that having repressed it there was a danger that it could start to spread again after restrictions are lifted. The first minister said that when measures are eased, the country could effectively go back into a contain strategy where the virus is kept in check via testing, tracing, and isolating. Dr Smith said there was real interest in developing a new app to help trace people who may have the virus, and said it looks very promising as a way of tracking cases - although he said it would be linked to traditional methods of contact tracing. Ms Sturgeon said when this happened in different parts of the UK would depend on the evidence, not a point of constitutional ideology either way. She said simplicity of messaging might make it easier to maintain a consistent approach across the whole UK, but said if the evidence showed different timescales or approaches should be used in Scotland then we will not hesitate to do that."

Before his death in 2018, the Liverpool legend praised the care he received from the marvellous NHS. His 1964 single has been re-recorded as a joy-filled tribute to NHS workers. Royle Family star Ricky Tomlinson is joined in the music video by Glenda Jackson, Rick Astley, Jimmy Tarbuck, Shirley Ballas, Claire Sweeney, Les Dennis and Carol Decker. The song, which also features dozens of nurses and families, includes people from Liverpool or around the area where Sir Ken was from. Tomlinson, who is filmed singing in his bath, said: We saw Madonna in her bath having a go, so we thought it's time we did an authentic Scouse song to get the nation smiling again and say a huge thank-you to all our amazing NHS staff. Liverpool unites in lock-down #HAPPINESS tribute to our NHS If this has made you smile - you can help - https://t.co/02Z19hHHam @rickastley @ShirleyBallas @ellisbarriebros @thechristians @frankcottrell_b @caroldecker @LesDennis @ianhartactor @MTLawrenson @sarker @clairesweeney pic.twitter.com/VOjeqsDw7n End of Twitter post by @TheComedyTrust Sir Ken's widow, Lady Anne Dodd, said: Ken would have loved the idea of cheering up everyone across the nation by singing together his Happiness song.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-52269084,Coronavirus: Ill baby girl tests positive for Covid-19,"A six-month-old baby is being treated in hospital for coronavirus, her parents have said. Erin Bates, of Bury, Greater Manchester, was already in Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool with a heart condition and windpipe problems. Her mother Emma Bates, 29, said she was heartbroken after Erin tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday. Her husband Wayne said Erin's condition was stable but he was upset people were not taking the virus seriously. The family have released a photo of Erin in hospital to encourage people to follow the government's social distancing rules. Mr Bates, 32, who is self-isolating at home while his wife is with Erin, said: People are still not taking this outbreak seriously and that upsets me. I take it personally. He added: Erin is stable but with most viruses we are waiting to see if it has peaked yet, things can change quickly. The hospital staff has been amazing. People need to stay home and keep safe. Mrs Bates is worried she might be separated from Erin if she catches Covid-19 herself. She said: If I show any symptoms I will then be taken to another hospital and Erin will be here alone. This alone breaks my heart that if things get worse our baby girl maybe on her own when she needs her mummy and daddy by her side. Erin has had a series of medical problems since she was born and needed open heart surgery in December. She has had to use a ventilator due to illnesses affecting her windpipe."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-52236389,Coronavirus: The grandad who became a TikTok star without realising it,"The grandad who became a TikTok star without realising it In less than three months an 87-year-old grandfather has gathered a huge following on the video-sharing app TikTok, despite the fact that most of its users are teenagers. And for a long time he was unaware of his growing fame, explains Chris Stokel-Walker. The video summed up the exasperation many elderly members of society have felt. Joe Allington, from Lichfield, walked the aisles of his local supermarket, eyes agog at the empty shelves he saw before him. He returned home downcast, with no shopping. This was before the government introduced strict social distancing rules and Allington began self-isolating. He didn't really need to go shopping as he's been living with his daughter and her family for the last four-and-a-half years, but the 14-second-long performance hit a nerve and has now been viewed more than 42 million times on the shortform video sharing app, TikTok. This is Allington's biggest success since he started posting on TikTok three months ago as Poppa Joe. To his surprise, he's picked up 1.5 million followers on a platform generally regarded as the preserve of teenagers. I don't think old people generally look at TikTok very much, admits Allington. It's all youngsters - seven and-eight-year-olds. Like many older people encountering smartphone apps for the first time, he has his granddaughter to thank. Allington's youngest granddaughter, Brooke Paintain, 15 - an active TikToker with more than 65,000 followers - first uploaded videos during the 2018 Christmas holidays, months after the app merged with lipsyncing platform Musical.ly. She was doing all these weird dances that kids do on TikTok, and trying to get me lipsyncing, says Allington. He wasn't interested at that point. It was only in January this year that he was finally persuaded to dance in a video. Allington also featured in one of Brooke's videos on 23 January. As she danced around him she directed her followers to his TikTok profile, asking them to get him up to 10,000 followers. Within three weeks, he had more than 30,000. I just don't know why I'm popular, he explains. I've never been popular like that in my life. A petrol tanker driver for decades, after leaving school at the age of 14 in the late 1940s, Allington progressed to work in transport management. He retired at the age of 65, and became the family clown to his daughter, Wendy Paintain, 54, and his granddaughters. When they suggested he join TikTok, it was a natural fit. I've found my second childhood, you know, he says. He combines high drama and sadness with a quirky side, making light of serious situations. In one video, he dances to classic song Oops in front of a green-screened image of him lying in bed after a massive heart attack in 2019. Another running theme of videos is his obsession with donuts - banned from his diet after his heart attack - and his attempts to eat them. There are also occasional references to the pain of losing his wife, who died in 2009. Allington claims he has little-to-no involvement in the videos he posts. Wendy coerced me into doing little bits of acting for the videos, which I did, and it's taken off from there, he says. I quite enjoy being made up, dressed up, and made a fool of. Wendy says: 'Dad, we're doing TikTok, we're doing this today.' Then I just do as I'm told. I'm very obedient, you know. He'll have a go at anything except dance challenges, one of the key currencies of TikTok virality. I'm not into waving my arms like that, he explains. I can't do it! Because of his hands-off approach, Allington had no idea he was becoming an internet celebrity, so he was startled when Wendy told him he had more than one million followers. It's really astounding to think there are so many people who know me as an old fool, he says. None of his friends know about his success, either. Until he was forced to self-isolate with his family, Allington went out for meals with them two or three times a week, and would take part in a local karaoke club every Saturday night. But they don't belong to the TikTok generation. Allington isn't the only superannuated TikToker, though. There's Grandad Frank, for example, a fleet-footed dancer who has more than 780,000 followers; and Granny Gone Wild, an American grandmother who combines comedy videos with speaking about being a survivor of domestic violence. Young TikTok users have a soft spot for grandparents, says Timothy Armoo of Fanbytes, an influencer marketing agency that manages TikTok stars. On TikTok, if you did something with your parents, people might think that's a bit cringe, he says. But if you did it with your grandparent, it's so incredible that your grandparent would know how to use TikTok, that it becomes quite cool. Now that he has got to know the app better, Allington is using it to connect with people he isn't seeing during isolation, the nine-year-old daughter of the barman at his local club, for example, and his elder granddaughter, Sasha. But he also uses FaceTime and Houseparty and so on, he says. Many of Allington's recent videos have been making light of the coronavirus-enforced quarantine. One, seen 457,000 times, saw him don Marigold washing-up gloves, multiple bin bags and a mask covering only his nose for his government-mandated daily walk. It feeds well into the whole coronavirus situation we find ourselves in, Armoo says. Right now, people are checking up on their grandparents and quite a lot of video content is going out with people taking care of their grandparents. Grandad Joe is pretty much the perfect embodiment of it."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-52268371,Coronavirus: PSNI issue 107 fines for breaching lockdown,"Police have issued 107 fines to people who did not heed the message to stay at home to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Officers broke up house parties, barbecues and children’s play dates, with some gatherings of more than 20 people, over the past three days. Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd said up to 90% of people had complied with the restrictions. Six more people diagnosed with Covid-19 have died in hospital in NI. That brings the number of reported hospital deaths in Northern Ireland to 124. There are 1,882 confirmed cases of coronavirus in NI. ACC Todd said “significant deployment” would continue on Easter Monday and Tuesday. He said fines were issued to those “who should not have been where they were and wouldn’t listen to the advice of officers when it was given”. House parties involved some dozen or more people, although some were bigger, he said. Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, he said an extra 120 extra crews had been deployed across Northern Ireland over the Easter break. Police stepped up their patrols at coastal beauty spots over the weekend, and ACC Todd said that would continue on Easter Monday and Easter Tuesday, with checkpoints on roads and officers at railway and bus stations. Chief Constable Simon Byrne tweeted a picture of himself out and about on patrol in County Antrim. He said the majority of people were adhering to the rules. Under the current rules, people are urged to stay at home and to only go out if they have a reasonable excuse, which includes exercise, shopping for basic necessities, healthcare and essential travel to or from work. On Monday, the Fire Brigades Union said NI's fire service had 147 members of staff in self-isolation. That represents 7.5% of the workforce, with 114 of them being front-line firefighters and control staff. The union says the UK average for total staff absence is 5.1%. Matt Wrack, FBU general secretary, said: If we aren't able to find out exactly who is infected and more staff isolate unnecessarily, services will be put on a dangerous knife-edge. Of course testing of NHS staff has to be a priority, but firefighters and other emergency service personnel are also at serious risk. The very safety of the public relies on them being able to attend work. Meanwhile, there is ongoing concern about the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) after GP leaders in Belfast said the system was in crisis due to a lack of the kit. In a letter to the Department of Health, the chairs of the north and west GP federations said they might be forced to withdraw services due to a particular shortage of masks and aprons. In a statement to BBC News NI, Health Minister Robin Swann said his department was working hard to ensure that vital supplies of PPE are maintained."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52270063,Coronavirus lockdown spares Czech women an Easter whipping,"The coronavirus lockdown has led to the suspension of a controversial Czech Easter tradition where men lightly whip women with a switch made of willow branches to ensure fertility. It is an Easter Monday ritual of pagan origin, popular in rural areas. Men go door-to-door, singing a ditty and whipping women's legs and buttocks. They are rewarded with painted eggs and shots of plum brandy. However, for many Czech women the ritual is far from harmless. It hurt like hell, said Ladka Bauerova, who grew up in Prague, not a village. Even as a child I felt acute embarrassment at the heavy-handed symbolism (you're giving men your eggs to stop them from being violent!?) It just wasn't right, she told the BBC. It can be seen either as a quaint rural custom with roots in pagan fertility rituals or an unacceptably sexist reminder of the power of the patriarchy. On Easter Monday, male villagers spend the morning going from house to house, whipping the village women. Frankly as the brandy-fuelled morning wears on, their ability to administer any kind of physical punishment is somewhat diminished. But wherever you stand on the tradition, it's not likely to be happening much this year as Interior Minister Jan Hamacek has urged Czech men to leave their whips at home. The Czech Republic has so far been only lightly affected by coronavirus - there were just 89 new cases on Sunday and a total of 139 Covid-19 deaths. However, the authorities are urging people to keep their guard up, including with the compulsory wearing of protective masks."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52216966,Coronavirus: When home gets violent under lockdown in Europe,"Flags were lowered to half-mast and three days of mourning were declared in the Spanish town of Almassora to mark Carina's death. In normal times, this community near Valencia would have gathered in silence to remember their 35-year-old neighbour. But confined to their homes by coronavirus, they paid their respects at a distance. The bells tolled and Mozart's Requiem boomed out from the town hall as residents came to their windows and balconies. Carina was killed at home in front of her two young children. Her husband José turned himself in to the town's civil guard and confessed. National lockdowns have heightened the danger for women forced to stay at home with their abusers, cut off from the respite of work and less able to call for help undetected. Children, mostly home from school, are now even more exposed to trauma. Carina was the 17th woman killed by a current or ex-partner in Spain this year. She was the first since restrictions to try to limit the spread of Covid-19 were imposed. Less than a month since Europe came to a near-standstill, it is too soon to see the full impact on gender violence from official statistics. But in abusive households, experts see a potentially devastating combination of emotions brewing. Women fear the aggressor inside the home and the virus outside. Stress makes abusers even more volatile, while heightened privacy gives them a feeling of impunity. In Spain, Kika Fumero traces it back to the state of alert declared on 14 March. From that moment I knew that what was good for stopping Covid-19 was going to be horrible for those women and their children who were in a violent situation at home, the head of the Canary Islands Institute for Equality told the BBC. She had seen the spikes in abuse from periods of confinement before, when women were forced to spend more time with their partner during floods or holidays. Italy, like Spain, has been at the forefront of the pandemic. More than 100 doctors there have lost their lives treating the sick. Lorena Quaranta, 27, was on the brink of qualifying as a doctor when she died on 30 March. But she was not a victim of Covid-19. Her boyfriend Antonio told police he had killed her. When her coffin returned to her hometown of Favara in Sicily, people hung white sheets from their balconies. It represented, as Mayor Anna Alba put it, the purity of her spirit, and the colour of that uniform she dreamed of wearing for the rest of her life. France initially reported a sharp drop in calls to the national helpline. But within a week the government said police reports of domestic abuse had gone up nationally by a third, and by even more in Paris. An SMS service set up for people with hearing impairments now helps abuse victims too and receives 170 text messages a day. Drop-in areas have been opened in shopping centres and there is a support service for perpetrators on the edge. In Spain, services for women facing gender-based violence are designated as essential, so their continued operation is guaranteed by the government. In the first two weeks of the state of alert, its 016 helpline received 18% more calls than in the same period the previous month. And, as in France, there are many silent requests for help. Email contact is up 286% over the same period and a new psychological support messaging service via WhatsApp received 168 enquiries in its first nine days. In Spain's Canary Islands, the Institute for Equality has launched a campaign called Mascarilla-19 (Mask-19), stressing that escaping abuse is a valid reason to leave your home. Pharmacies are widespread and among the few places people can still freely visit. When a woman experiences violence at home or sexual assault, she can go to the nearest pharmacy and request Mask-19 - the mask that will save her life, says Kika Fumero, who came up with the idea. Pharmacy staff take a woman's name, address and phone number and alert the emergency services. She can go home, or wait until police and support workers arrive. One woman in Tenerife spent two weeks stuck at her partner's home after the state of alert was declared, before she was able to give the code word in a pharmacy while he waited outside. She has since filed a complaint and returned to her family home. A 78-year-old killed by her husband in Gran Canaria was the second victim of femicide during Spain's lockdown. Older women endure mistreatment for 15 years on average before they report it, says the government's gender violence delegate Vicky Rosell. Denounce it yourself. Do it for them. This too saves lives, she says. Mask-19 has now been adopted across Spain, as well as in France, Germany, Italy, Norway and Argentina. Virginia Gil, who runs the Aspacia foundation in Madrid, fears the number of women reporting domestic abuse under the lockdown is just the tip of the iceberg. Women face several barriers, she believes: fear of being discovered by their abuser, anxiety about possible coronavirus infection outside the home, and uncertainty about which local services are operating. Ms Gil fears some abusers who would ordinarily be removed from the home are not being taken into custody by police or brought before paralysed courts. In Russia, the dilemma about leaving or staying was particularly hard for Maria, living in a flat 113km (70 miles) west of Moscow. Maria, not her real name, had never been hit by her husband before. But on 26 March he flew into rage that lasted 18 hours. At first, there was verbal abuse. Then he started breaking things and throwing them at me and the kids, she told BBC Russian. He smashed everything up, from the fish tank to the fridge. My children were scared. She believes the catalyst for her husband's attack was President Vladimir Putin's announcement of a non-working week - and the loss of income that came with it. When he left to buy beer, she called the police. They told me they couldn't throw him out because it was his flat, she said. It was up to her to find a shelter for herself and her children. Calls in Denmark for emergency accommodation almost doubled in the week after the government told people to stay at home. The government has since funded 55 extra rooms in shelters for four months and on Wednesday the lockdown will be eased, allowing some Danish schools to reopen and giving an opportunity for women to seek help. One way or the other, we'll make sure there's room for everyone, says Susanne Lamhauge, head of a new crisis centre run by women's rights group Danner. In Belgium, Jean-Louis Simoens describes a three-fold increase in calls to the listening service of the Collective Against Family Violence and Exclusion (CVFE). When I was manning the phones, a woman called and told me she only had 15 minutes to speak while her husband was out buying cigarettes. She was very frightened and we had to talk really quickly. He had hit her so badly, her face was so swollen, that she couldn't open her eyes any more. The confinement had made his behaviour worse, so Mr Simoens helped her plan where to go if he went out. As calls are anonymous, he has no idea if she managed to escape. The threat of infection from coronavirus is in some cases a very direct obstacle to getting help, according to Marceline Naudi, who heads the Council of Europe's group of gender violence experts. In some cases, it means that women victims of violence have decided not to seek medical attention for fear of contagion, but there are also fewer places to turn to. Domestic violence shelters in some areas have already stopped all admissions, because they are unsure how to manage the risk of infection, she says. She also fears that by losing a job or income women will become more financially dependent on an abuser and it will be harder to leave. In a pandemic that has killed tens of thousands of people across Europe, the message to an anxious public is that staying home means staying safe and saving lives. That mantra is of little comfort to women imprisoned with an abuser, weighing up their chances of a successful escape amid so much uncertainty. For many, it is an impossible choice.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-52265917,Coronavirus: Japan rushes to house thousands of homeless people,"Japanese authorities are rushing to house thousands of homeless people following the closure of internet cafes in several major cities. The cafes have become a common destination for those without secure housing. They're often open around the clock and many feature private booths, showers and entertainment, including games. But the businesses have been ordered to close their doors to help contain the spread of coronavirus. While Japan officially has a low homeless rate compared with many other developed nations, more than 4,000 internet cafe refugees reside in the capital, Tokyo. City officials say they have begun providing them with hotel rooms and other forms of temporary accommodation. In neighbouring Saitama, authorities have also repurposed a sports hall for 200 people. Tokyo's government says welfare offices can send homeless residents to designated temporary accommodation, according to the Nikkei Asian Review. But Kazuhiro Gokan, a consultant with a local homeless support group, told the newspaper that many people had been turned away because of a misunderstanding among administrators. Japan has a relatively small number of infections compared with other countries - 6,748 confirmed cases and 108 virus-related deaths as of Sunday. But there are concerns a recent surge in cases in Tokyo could lead to a major outbreak. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has declared a month-long state of emergency, covering Tokyo, Osaka and five other prefectures. The governors of these prefectures now have the power to close schools and businesses, but no legal authority to order citizens to stay at home."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-52215071,Coronavirus: India's race against time to save doctors,"India, like most parts of the world, is in a race against time to procure personal protective equipment (PPE) for the safety of its medical teams fighting to halt the spread of coronavirus. The country has reported more than 8,500 coronavirus cases and at least 289 have died. The first 100 cases were mostly reported in cities, but now more people have tested positive in smaller towns and cities. This has generated a huge demand for protective equipment for doctors and health workers across the country, and state governments are struggling to cope with it. In some cases, doctors were forced to use raincoats and motorbike helmets. One doctor, who is working in the state-run hospital in the northern city of Lucknow, said: We are not getting PPE kits as fast as we should. This is really a war and we are being compared to soldiers. But you don't send soldiers to fight a war without ammunition, she told the BBC. Several doctors and nurses have tested positive in cities like Delhi and Mumbai and the hospitals where they worked have been shut down. This has raised serious concerns about the safety of frontline medical staff. But PPE kits are also needed for law enforcement agencies who are helping health workers with contact tracing and the management of quarantine facilities. A senior police officer in Uttar Pradesh told the BBC that policemen are also directly exposed to the risk of coronavirus infection. Recently a man who had tested positive ran away from a quarantine facility. The police had to bring him back. So, we also need to protect ourselves, he said. The policeman added that we have PPE for now but more will be needed in the near future. Several state chief ministers have also said that more PPE are needed to protect emergency workers. We urgently need PPE kits and have written to the central government about it. I do not want the doctors and nurses to work without the protective gear, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal recently said. India needs at least a million PPE kits, as well as 40 million N95 masks, 20 million surgical masks and a million litres of hand sanitisers at the moment, according to HLL Lifecare Limited, a government-owned body that has been tasked to procure PPE. The federal ministry of health on 9 April said that it had placed orders for 17 million PPE kits - which is way more than the HLL Lifecare Limited's estimates. The ministry said it has approved 20 domestic manufacturers to produce protective gears. But it's unclear how quickly the manufacturers can meet the demand. The ministry said in a press release on 30 March that the suppliers were able to produce a total of 15,000 kits per day. It also added that orders are being placed with foreign manufacturers from countries like Singapore and China, and some have come in the form of donations. But the fear is that even this supply may not be enough if the pandemic spreads widely in smaller districts and towns. Several smaller firms and self-help groups have come forward to bridge the gap - but they are mostly making masks and face shields. Maker's Asylum, a collective that provides tools and space to designers, came up with the idea of face shields for frontline workers. Richa Srivastava, the collective's managing partner, said we usually provide tools and space for designers. But we took on manufacturing because the country needs it. The face shield stops people from touching their faces frequently, she told the BBC. Ms Srivastava added that they have activated 12 such labs across the country and have so far manufactured 100,000 face shields. Women-led groups in several states, including Kerala in the south and Indian-administered Kashmir in the north, are also making cloth masks. But it's the production of medical-grade PPE that India desperately needs to ramp up. Public health expert Anant Bhan told the BBC that the government should have taken decisions quickly. We knew in January that the pandemic was coming and we should have started stockpiling sooner, he said. The government released production specification for PPE only on 23 March. Mr Bhan said that it was too late for manufacturers to quickly ramp up production. They need to source raw material and adjust production lines to meet the specification. And that takes time, he said. Experts say that there are other areas where the government can look into to meet the demand. Rajiv Nath, of the Association of Indian Medical Device Industry, told the BBC that the government should import raw material quickly and sign up more manufacturers. Garment exporters, manufacturers of army uniforms should be roped in because specifications are now available, he said. But Mr Bhan feels it's not going to be easy. It's admirable that clothes-making factories are coming forward to help. But PPE manufacturing requires specific skills and expertise, he said. He added that quality control is the key because there is no point in having bad PPEs. This virus is highly contagious and the only defence medical teams have is good-quality PPEs, he said. But quality control is not the only issue. The country is in a complete lockdown. Exporters say it is difficult for them to get workforce and procure raw material. Mr Bhan says that such worries are real. PPE manufacturing has to be taken as an emergency. Entire state machinery has to come together. Passes have to be given to factories and their workers so they can move easily, he said. Ensuring supplies to remote corners of the country is another challenge. Mr Bhan say there is no point in making PPE if they can't reach the one who need them the most. It's okay to compare our doctors with soldiers - but they shouldn't be asked to make this heroic choice of going to work without proper protection, he added."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-52267943,Coronavirus: Five ways the outbreak is hitting global food industry,"As the world's population was plunged into lockdown, our social media feeds became filled with stories of shortages at local supermarkets. But with many restaurants and other areas of the hospitality industry effectively shut for business, food producers are warning they actually have too much stock which will now go to waste. These are some of the ways the coronavirus pandemic is impacting the supply chain of food around the world. With coffee shops closed completely in some countries, oversupply of milk is emerging as a real side-effect of the pandemic. Dairy Farmers of America, the country's biggest dairy co-operative, is estimating that farmers are having to dump 3.7 million gallons (14 million litres) of milk every single day because of disrupted supply routes. This issue is not only being seen in the US, with dairy farmers in the UK asking for government help because of their own surplus problems. Peter Alvis, chair of the Royal Association of British Dairy Farmers, says about five million litres per week are at risk. He warned farmers receiving reduced value for their output or having to dump their excess are faced with severe economic repercussions amid already tight margins. Closures are impacting all areas of agriculture. Some producers have tried to pivot to supplying ordinary shoppers, but changed market demand and excess stock remains a problem across the sector. The New York Times, which interviewed some US producers, cited an example of one chicken processor having to smash 750,000 unhatched eggs every single week. They also spoke to an onion farmer who was having to let most of his harvest decompose, unable to re-distribute his onions in high enough qualities and without the facilities to store them. In India, tea planters are warning that lockdown measures have already caused the first wave of their precious Darjeeling crop to go to waste and there are fears for the second. On top of oversupply and the difficulty in pivoting toward retail consumers, farmers in a lot of places are also encountering problems because of staffing shortages. Self-isolation and social distancing guidelines are reportedly slowing picking efforts in places, and national lockdowns are disrupting the usual international flow of labour across the industry. Last week Germany made an exception to its country's lockdown to allow thousands of Romanian and Polish workers to fly in to help with the spring harvest, especially with picking strawberries and asparagus. There has also been a 'Feed the Nation' campaign launched in the UK to encourage domestic workers to plug any labour gaps to avoid food waste. The pandemic has led to some changes in what we are trying to buy. For example, the UK has seen demand for flour soar in recent weeks as people stuck at home increasingly turn to home-baking. According to new data, cited by BFMTV, French shoppers have increasingly been buying more organic food since coronavirus fears took hold of the country. This could be because they are shopping at smaller, local stores - experts say - or because people want to eat more healthy and local food during the outbreak. The revelation comes as France's minister for agriculture called on local officials to promote the re-opening of food markets across the country. They were previously ordered shut over safety concerns, but have been gradually returning with guarantees that social distancing rules are in place. Take UK pub closures for example. Much of the industry's current supply of lager and ale could now go to waste under government rules which mean they could be closed for the foreseeable future. Some beers have a best-before date of just weeks - which means thousands of unused barrels in pub basements could be undrinkable by the time the lockdown is lifted. People in the industry warn this could mean large financial losses for businesses. Some parts of the food industry are benefiting from our changing consumption habits. US sales of orange juice, which had been on a gradual decline, are said to be up 38% on last year's figures. The so-called futures price of orange juice has soared in recent weeks. The Covid-19 outbreaks are hitting both the supply and demand for orange juice, Stephen Innes, chief global market strategist at broker AxiCorp said last month. The immune-boosting properties are the demand-side attraction while there are simply not enough tanker spaces, with airlines not flying, to bring the product to markets. The demand is good news for orange growers, especially in Florida and Brazil - who supply big brands like Tropicana."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52264743,Apollo 13: Enhanced images reveal life on stricken spacecraft,"Image enhancement techniques have been used to reveal life aboard Nasa's stricken Apollo 13 spacecraft in unprecedented detail. Fifty years ago, the craft suffered an explosion that jeopardised the lives of the three astronauts aboard. Unsurprisingly, given they were locked in a fight for survival, relatively few onboard images were taken. But imaging specialist Andy Saunders created sharp stills from low-quality 16mm film shot by the crew. One of the techniques used by Mr Saunders is known as stacking, in which many frames are assembled on top of each other to improve the image's detail. Crewed by Nasa astronauts Jim Lovell, Jack Swigert and Fred Haise, Apollo 13 was supposed to be the third American mission to land on the lunar surface. During the journey to the Moon, an explosion in the service module allowed some of the spacecraft's oxygen to leak out into space. Astronaut Jack Swigert reported the accident to ground controllers with the immortal, and much misquoted, phrase: Okay, Houston, we've had a problem here. The part of the Apollo spacecraft designed to return the astronauts through Earth's atmosphere after the mission - the command module (CM) - had to be shut down to conserve its remaining resources for re-entry. The crew had to use the lunar module (LM) - also known as the lander - as a lifeboat. The lander's life support systems were designed for two astronauts living for two days on the lunar surface. Experts at Nasa's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, had to figure out a way to stretch its resources so that it could support three crew members for four days. Lovell, Swigert and Haise looped around the Moon and back to Earth in a cold, damp module with limited drinking water. Luckily, the improvised plan to get them back was a success, and the three astronauts splashed down safely into the Pacific Ocean. Despite their grave predicament, the crew used a 16mm film camera to record scenes of life aboard the spacecraft. But the footage is of low quality by today's standards. It is this footage that Mr Saunders used as the basis of his enhanced images, which reveal new insights into the crew's fight for survival aboard the damaged spacecraft. A composite panorama of the lunar module lifeboat shows Commander Jim Lovell's attempts at normality by selecting some music on a tape player, while command module pilot Jack Swigert takes a nap in the storage area. Another, dubbed Happy crew by Mr Saunders, captures Lovell and Swigert in apparent high spirits. One striking thing about the 16mm footage is how calm the crew appear, given the grave nature of the situation, the conditions, and the critical mission tasks that lay ahead, Mr Saunders told BBC News. This perhaps belies their true feelings as we know that, in reality, the crew doubted if they would make it home alive. The crew members are eating in the scene. The freeze-dried food relied on mixing it with hot water, but only cold water was available. Lovell later admitted he had eaten little in the days following the accident, losing 6kg (14lb) in weight. A panorama of the dark, powered-down command module was produced from footage shot by Fred Haise when he went to check it out before the rest of the crew moved back in for the risky return through the Earth's atmosphere. In an interview for a new Nasa documentary called Apollo 13: Home Safe, Haise recalls how damp it was in the CM. The astronauts had to wipe down the panels with towels because of a concern that the water could cause an electrical short that could lead to a fire. This would have been catastrophic in the spacecraft's enclosed environment. Two concepts are important for understanding the technique used to process the images: signal - the parts of the image that are desirable to keep - and noise - the unwanted parts of the image. Mr Saunders started by stacking different frames of the same scene on top of one another. It all hinges on the principle that stacking images improves the signal-to-noise ratio, Mr Saunders explained. He added: As the noise in each frame is truly random, then stacking multiple frames of the same scene on top of each other and averaging out the levels of each aligned pixel has the effect of identifying and reducing noise whilst maintaining signal (the signal will be present on all frames). This ultimately boosts the detail, along with overall image quality, making it more photo-like. But because he was dealing with moving pictures, Mr Saunders had to re-align multiple parts of the image, combining all the results into one final picture. These combined images are made up of more than 20 sections stitched together, with each section consisting of a stack of up to 75 separate processed frames, revealing the crew and spacecraft in unprecedented detail. Using commercial software, he then enhanced the photos; adjusting the contrast, correcting the colour and removing some of the fish-eye effect resulting from the wide angle lens that was needed to capture events in such a confined space. More restored images from the Apollo missions, including those from the Apollo 13, can be viewed on Andy Saunders' Twitter feed. Follow Paul on Twitter."

Sheila Atieno* is on standby to help a young woman who is 32 weeks pregnant deliver her baby. Dr Atieno has done this many times before. But this birth, when it happens, will be unusual. The expectant woman was brought into a special ward at a public hospital in the capital, Nairobi, after testing positive for coronavirus. Dr Atieno, a consultant obstetrician gynaecologist, is part of a small team of doctors who have been identified to attend to expectant women who display symptoms of the virus. Dr Atieno's world has changed drastically. She is a mother of two children under the age of two years. It's been very difficult to cope with the fact that I will be specifically attending to expectant mothers who are infected with the virus, she tells me. I'm about to perform a caesarean section, which usually involves handling a lot of body fluids. Although I'll carry out the operation while dressed in a protective suit, it makes you quite hot and uncomfortable. And when I get home, the children will want to rush into my arms. But I can't touch them until I have changed, showered and sanitised myself. It's tough mentally and emotionally. But I have no choice - it's my job to usher in new life, with or without the pandemic, Dr Atieno says. Francis and Veronica Gitonga are a young couple on honeymoon at their rural home in Nyahururu, which is about 200km (125 miles) from Nairobi. They had planned their wedding for 5 April. They invited 500 guests to witness the big moment when they would each say: I do! But when they did, only six people were allowed inside the church - the bride, the groom, their best couple and two presiding pastors. No parents, no family, no village mates. Social distancing rules and travel restrictions brought about by Covid-19 distanced hundreds of people from their wedding. The couple held their wedding reception at home with only 12 people present. They had the option of postponing their wedding until life returns to normal. But they chose not to. I asked the couple if they regretted not delaying the wedding to allow more of their family and friends to attend. No, we have no regrets, says Mr Gitonga, who works with the Redeemed Gospel Church in Nyahururu. We felt like God had spoken to us to go ahead with the wedding. After all, Veronica and I love each other deeply and being joined together in church before God was all we ever wanted. Mr Gitonga told me Covid-19 not only changed the couple's wedding plans, it brought some unexpected benefits. Our wedding was going to cost about 300,000 Kenya shillings ($2,800; £2,250). But without the guests, the catering, hire of a venue, etc, in the end we only spent 50,000 Kenya shillings. And now we are receiving a lot of calls from young people in different parts of Kenya saying we inspired them to do humble weddings instead of marrying big and then falling into debt. Mr and Mrs Gitonga's is a story of true love in the midst of a pandemic. It's also the shape of a new normal in Kenya - small, intimate and pocket-friendly weddings. During the night-time curfew imposed by the government to try and curb the spread of the virus, a 13-year-old boy, Yassin Hussein Moyo, was shot dead by police. Police enforcing curfew in Kenya's capital Nairobi are accused of fatally shooting a 13-year-old boy on the family's balcony.Yassin Moyo, his five siblings and his mother were seated on their balcony on Monday evening. #YassinMoyo #YusufMoyo https://t.co/oneuBJZjw9 pic.twitter.com/MkZw2Iuw7X End of Twitter post by @faceofmalawi Yassin is not the only victim. Across the country people are nursing broken limbs and other serious injuries inflicted by the heavy hand of a police force whose motto ironically is, Service to all. Covid-19 has opened the door to state-sanctioned brutality. Yassin's father, Hussein Moyo, bitterly captured the sentiments of many Kenyans when he said at his son's funeral: During the day we face the threat of the virus and at night we have to contend with police terror. Kenyans, most of whom earn a meagre income from the informal sector, are frequently heard on radio and TV explaining how they have to grapple with three enemies - the new coronavirus, hunger and the police. James Orengo is a veteran politician and an elected senator from the main opposition Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party. He usually has his finger on the pulse of the nation. At a special Senate sitting on electoral laws in January 2017, Mr Orengo, who is a lawyer, spoke on the dangers of passing bad laws and famously warned ruling party legislators not to be too comfortable in government. Sometimes revolutions eat their own children… governments eat their own people. This government is going to punish you more than they will punish me, I am telling you, he said. In another one year you'll be crying in my office to come and represent you. That quote is one of the most cited by Kenyans. But with Covid-19, Mr Orengo misread the mood of the public when he tweeted: Drove myself to parliament to take the COVID-19 test. Compliance with the guidelines critical in the fight against the pandemic. Drove myself to parliament to take the COVID-19 test. Compliance with the guidelines critical in the fight against the pandemic. pic.twitter.com/ojCzeQCk1f End of Twitter post by @orengo_james The backlash was immediate. So where do commoners like us drive ourselves to? tweeted one Kenyan, and another tweeted: Politicians really think that driving themselves is such a big deal. What's wrong with this country? Overall, the Covid-19 crisis has wiped away politicians' ubiquitous presence from the media and Kenyans seem to be enjoying the peace and quiet. There appears to be an unspoken rule among media organisations - keep politicians off the news agenda unless they are speaking in a medical or other relevant professional capacity. Politicians must be worrying what will happen if Kenyans get used to life without them. Covid-19 has forced justice to go digital in Kenya with some magistrates using video links to serve their orders. One beneficiary of this is a man accused of stealing a bible from a supermarket. Following proceedings via a TV screen while in police custody, he was relieved to hear that he will now continue his case as a free person after the judge ordered his release on a free bond. It's part of new government efforts to tackle Covid-19 by decongesting prisons, which has already resulted in the release of 4,800 petty offenders. The man in the bible court case will no doubt be using a bible to join other Kenyans praying to be spared the worst ravages of Covid-19. Life, clearly, cannot be the same again. * The doctor's real name was not used because she was not authorised to speak to the media."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-52196817,Coronavirus: What's the latest with Brexit and other big stories?,"Over the past few months, the coronavirus pandemic has absorbed all the energy of the news cycle. There hasn't been an event like it in our lifetimes. But this isn't to say that it's the only important thing happening in the world right now. So what's going on elsewhere - and what happened to some of the other big news stories of the year? Remember Brexit? For about three years you hardly heard about anything else in the UK. Now, of course, the focus is on the coronavirus pandemic. Despite Prime Minister Boris Johnson requiring hospital treatment after contracting Covid-19 and the European Union and UK chief negotiators only recently coming out of coronavirus quarantine, Downing Street insists it will stick to its original timetable. The UK formally left the European Union on 31 January. But we are now in a transition period up to 31 December, during which the UK is still treated pretty much as an EU member while negotiations continue. Britain's government says an EU-UK trade deal must be in place by the last day of the year. But even if not, the UK won't prolong the transition period beyond that deadline. The idea behind the transition period was to minimise disruption caused to business and travel between the UK and the EU. It can be extended by a year or two - which the EU thinks would be a sensible move under the circumstances. There has only been one round of EU-UK trade negotiations so far. They restart this week via video conference and both sides say they'll do their best to make good and speedy progress. But time is slipping away. Brussels also asks whether UK and EU businesses - already struggling with the upheaval caused by the coronavirus - need another big change come the end of this year. But whatever they think, EU leaders won't formally ask the UK for an extension. The tight timetable was decided by Boris Johnson, they say. A decision to delay - if there is one - must come from London. A ceasefire few expected to last is holding in Idlib, for now, as the last rebel-held area in northwest Syria braces for the expected onslaught of the deadly coronavirus. People are breathing for the time being, and that can be viewed as a side effect of the pandemic, says Hassan Hassan of the Center for Global Policy. The ceasefire is hanging by a thread, but it's hanging nonetheless. The 5 March truce agreed by Russia and Turkey halted a dangerous escalation after Ankara sent thousands of its troops across the border to try to halt a Syrian offensive to retake this last province lost in nine punishing years of war. But Idlib's breathing space is also fraught with fear of this new enemy. The province's health system has been decimated by fighting, including the blistering air campaign by Russian and Syrian warplanes. Nearly a million displaced people, sheltering inside flimsy tents, or on open ground, have few defences against the powerful Covid-19. There's a humanitarian and political imperative… for a complete, immediate nationwide ceasefire throughout Syria, said UN Special Envoy to Syria, Geir Pedersen, in his recent briefing to the UN Security Council. Turkey and Russia, who back opposing sides, now call the shots. I don't think Turkey or Russia believe this ceasefire will hold for a long time, says Dareen Khalifa, Senior Analyst with the International Crisis Group. It left key issues unresolved. That includes the future of the jihadist group Hayat Tahir al-Sham (HTS), which dominates Idlib. The HTS, sceptical of this truce, is said to be regrouping. The Syrian and Turkish armies are also taking advantage of this pause to reinforce in preparation for the next round of battle. It may be just a matter of time - but now, it seems, is not the time. For nearly a month, the race among Democrats to see who would take on US President Donald Trump in the general election was in deep freeze. Former Vice-President Joe Biden had a commanding lead in the primaries, but self-professed democratic socialist Bernie Sanders - once considered the front-runner - was unwilling to concede. Meanwhile, state after state postponed their primary votes because of the coronavirus pandemic. Both candidates cancelled all public events and only issued video statements and conducted interviews from their homes. That changed on Wednesday, as Sanders suspended his campaign, all but ensuring that in November American voters will choose between Trump and Biden. Exactly when - and how - the two candidates will be formally nominated by their parties is in some doubt, however. The Democrats have already moved their national convention from mid-July to August in the hope that a gathering of thousands of activists, officials and party faithful will then be possible, both from a health and logistical standpoint. But that new date, along with the Republican convention set for the end of August, still seems questionable. As for the race itself, Trump has seen a slight bump in his poll standings since the pandemic began, perhaps due to his ubiquitous television presence in daily afternoon White House press conferences. Biden still holds a slight advantage in head-to-head matchups, however, suggesting the race is destined to be close. But there's no telling what the national mood will be in a few weeks, let alone when the November voting day arrives. The conflict in Yemen, which entered its sixth year in March, has long been labelled the world's forgotten war. With the past few weeks seeing yet another spike in the fighting, and as the world's attention is firmly fixed elsewhere, Yemen's war has felt more forgotten than ever. Two weeks ago, attacks on cities in Saudi Arabia, claimed by Houthi rebels, led to a series of retaliatory airstrikes on Northern Yemen by the Saudi-led coalition. It isn't just the fighting that Yemen's civilians are having to endure. I remember reporting on the cholera epidemic in 2016, and memories of the country's inability to respond to the spread of the disease are still fresh in my mind. It was heart-breaking to watch as people who had contracted the disease found they had no hospital to turn to. That Yemen is now facing the threat of a new ruthless disease, one which requires hospital beds and ventilators the country doesn't have, is a terrifying prospect. The announcement of a ceasefire this week will be welcome news for most Yemenis, but the heavy toll of the past half-decade means that even if the war was to end today, it would take decades for the country to recover. Six years of bombings and destruction have resulted in what the UN has called the world's worst humanitarian crisis. The scale, severity and complexity of the country's needs are staggering. The war has deeply fractured Yemen's economy and reduced its public institutions, its infrastructure and its health system to rubble. Eighty per cent of the entire population require external aid just to survive. And yet, the UN announced this week that it was decreasing its operations in the country, citing lack of funding. As the spectre of Covid-19 looms larger, people across Yemen, fully aware that their country simply won't be able to cope against the impending threat, are bracing themselves. In early November, the New South Wales government announced a state of emergency and issued the first catastrophic fire warning since the rating was put in place 10 years ago. Record-breaking heat, strong winds and the relentless drought - which lasted for at least three years in some areas - fuelled the bushfires. The blazes left 11 million hectares scorched and more than 2,000 properties destroyed. Australia's wildlife was decimated. One billion animals were lost and pictures of burned koalas and kangaroos made global headlines. The controversy and anger towards the prime minister and the way he handled the crisis and his approach to climate change were as much a part of the story as the fires themselves. Eventually the rain came, flooding some areas while ending years of drought in others. There was enough rain to put out most of the fires until they were all under control. It was a huge reprieve for the volunteer firefighters who had not stopped working for months and were exhausted. On 31 March, the New South Wales Rural Fire Service announced the official end of the most destructive bushfire season the state and the country has experienced. Although the fires are out, the damage is still there. The bushfires had a catastrophic impact on the economy - especially in the tourism sector. Many communities have been trying to rebuild, but it's been a slow and difficult process, now made more difficult by the fact everything is on hold because of Covid-19. Many families are worried that with the government now turning their full attention to tackling the virus, their own losses and struggles will be forgotten."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52211205,Coronavirus: Food delivery driver paying back doctors who saved him,"Doctors and nurses are people who saved me from cancer and gave me strength in the darkest time. I need to return the favour, says Li Yan, a food delivery rider based in Beijing. Mr Li was diagnosed with lymph cancer in 2003, when he was just 17 years old. He recovered from the disease and has been full of gratitude ever since for the medical workers who nursed him back to health. With China in a national lockdown, food delivery firms found themselves in hot demand providing meals for residents stuck at home to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. As a delivery rider for Meituan, one of China's biggest food delivery firms, Mr Li saw an opportunity to repay the medical professionals he admires by providing them with food and drinks as they worked tirelessly on patients across the city. Given my past experience, I felt I needed to do something for them in return during the virus outbreak, he adds. Beijing is a city of 21 million residents, and Mr Li covers its Tongzhou district, where there are a handful of hospitals with fever clinics, one of which is a designated hospital for Covid-19 treatment. Many might have concerns delivering for the hospital, but I've chosen to deliver for them more often. I just think of the local residents and medical workers who need us. I can't leave them being hungry. It's not for money. Before the outbreak in China, he delivered more than 50 orders on an average day. But during the first ten days after the coronavirus outbreak in late January, the number of orders dropped to less than 20, as some restaurants were closed. The outbreak also coincided with the Chinese New Year period which is normally a low season. By mid-February when the situation was brought more under control, and people's concerns and fears gradually began to ease, orders started to be restored. I can deliver over 40 orders a day now. During this time, Meituan brought in a contactless delivery option which allowed food to be dropped off at designated points to avoid contact between customers and riders. When I called customers to explain, some initially didn't understand and wanted to cancel the order. But gradually people grew more understanding and began to welcome the contactless approach. China was in lockdown for more than two months, although restrictions are now beginning to be lifted. It will still take time before a sense of normalcy returns. I remember when the coronavirus first broke out, it was hazy for a few days in Beijing. Streets were empty and stores were closed. An ambulance or a delivery rider occasionally drove by. It felt like I was living in a different world. Mr Li says restaurants have started to re-open and people have begun coming back to work in the office since mid-February. Orders are still lower than normal but are improving. I miss the hustling Beijing which used to filled with traffic, the days when I could smell car exhaust when I stop at crossroads, the times when I had to walk all the way up to the 6th floor to deliver food, and even times when I was late for a delivery. When the virus first broke out, face masks and alcohol disinfectant were the most ordered items along with supermarket groceries. Grains, rice, cooking oil, vegetables, fruits, and solid, packaged food that lasts long. Orders often came in big sizes and transaction prices at around 200 yuan [£23; $28] to 300 yuan on one order. Being a food delivery rider, Mr Li feels he can not only give back to the medical community but to the city's vulnerable too. I once received an order that came with a note saying the customer is a 82-year-old who lives alone and couldn't get downstairs to pick up the food so the rider needs to enter the residential community and deliver food to the door. I had to spend some time communicating with security and finally was allowed in. The door was open when I arrived, and I put the bowl of wontons [a type of dumpling] on the table. Tips have increased from happy customers during the pandemic as a result. Many more send me thank-you notes in the Meituan app and tell me to take care. Mr Li has a new routine now which involves lots of disinfecting and temperature checks. I get my temperature checked dozens of times everyday now, before entering shopping malls, at restaurants, and returning home to the residential compound I live in. I also bring with me disinfectant sprays, a towel in my scooter and use disposable gloves when delivering to areas with reported confirmed cases. While he's providing a vital service, is Mr Li worried about the risk of infection? I did have worries when the virus spread and was at its worst time here but I feel like I've already been there, given what I went through in the fight against cancer. I've learnt to take things easy, look at the bright side of things and always seek strength in a dark time. As long as I take sufficient precautions, masks, gloves, disinfectants and everything, and follow advice from disease control experts, I think the possibility of getting the virus is pretty low. And with a seven-month pregnant wife at home, Mr Li is looking forward to happier times."

Various historical accounts describe them as the mainstay of the Sikh warrior army that took up the cudgels with India's former Mughal rulers. Dressed up in their trademark blue, they are known for their martial arts and sword-fighting skills. The sect was responsible for protecting the Sikh faith and its followers. The group's role is largely ceremonial in the present context, but they still carry swords and knives as a part of their attire."

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52267383,"50,000-year-old string found at France Neanderthal site","A piece of 50,000-year-old string - the oldest yet discovered - found in a cave in France has cast further doubt on the idea that Neanderthals were cognitively inferior to modern humans. A study published in Scientific Reports said a tiny, three-ply cord fragment made from bark was spotted on a stone tool recovered from the Abri du Maras. It implies that Neanderthals understood concepts like pairs, sets and numbers. Twisted fibres provide the basis for clothes, bags, nets and even boats. Neanderthals - whose species died out about 40,000 years ago - are already known to have made birch bark tar, art and shell beads. They also controlled fire, lived in shelters, were skilled hunters of large animals and deliberately buried their dead in graves. Typically, archaeologists and paleoanthropologists only find faunal remains or stone tools at sites like the Abri du Maras. Perishable materials are usually missing. But a team of researchers from France, the US and Spain discovered a fragment of cord adhering to the underside of a 60mm- (2.4-inch-) long stone tool. The cord, believed to have been made with the inner bark of a conifer tree, was approximately 6.2mm long and 0.5mm wide. Three groups of fibres were separated and twisted clockwise in an S-twist. Once twisted, the strands were twined anti-clockwise in Z-twist to form a cord. The study - whose lead author was Bruce Hardy of Kenyon College in Ohio - concluded that the production of the cord demonstrated that Neanderthals had a detailed ecological understanding of trees and how to transform them into entirely different functional substances. The production of the cord also implied a cognitive understanding of numeracy and context-sensitive operational memory, according to the study. That is because it required keeping track of multiple, sequential operations simultaneously. Given the ongoing revelations of Neanderthal art and technology, it is difficult to see how we can regard Neanderthals as anything other than the cognitive equals of modern humans, the study said."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52267376,Coronavirus: Spain begins to ease lockdown to revive economy,"Spain, one of the countries worst hit by the coronavirus, is beginning to ease strict lockdown measures that have brought its economy to a standstill. People in manufacturing, construction and some services are being allowed to return to work, but must stick to strict safety guidelines. The rest of the population must still remain at home. Almost 17,500 people with Covid-19 have died in Spain, but the rate of new infections has been falling. Italy - the hardest hit country in Europe, with almost 19,900 deaths - will allow a narrow range of firms to resume operations on Tuesday. Spain's health ministry said on Monday that the daily number of deaths had dipped slightly, with 517 reported in the previous 24 hours, compared with 619 announced on Sunday. The official total death toll is now 17,489. The number of new infections continues to drop, with 3,477 confirmed cases bringing the total to 169,496. We are still far from victory, from the moment when we will recover normality in our lives, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez warned over the weekend. We are all keen to go back out on the streets... but our desire is even greater to win the war and prevent a relapse, he added. On Monday, the government lifted some of the restrictions put in place on 27 March and allowed businesses whose employees cannot work remotely to reopen. Officials intend to distribute 10 million face masks on public transport. The head of the regional administration in Catalonia, Quim Torra, said he would not comply with any easing of the lockdown for non-essential workers, warning that the risk of a new outbreak and a second lockdown is enormous. Mr Sánchez said the decision was taken after consulting a committee of experts. He also noted that Spain had not entered the second phase of the fight against the coronavirus, when there would be any further loosening of the lockdown. That was at least two weeks away and would be very gradual, he added. Builders can only work in areas away from local residents, so they cannot yet go back to doing home improvements. By Guy Hedgecoe in Madrid The lifting of some lockdown restrictions in Spain today has meant a return to normality of sorts for many non-essential workers. Two weeks ago they were told to stay at home as the national lockdown was tightened. On the Madrid metro and at bus and railway stations, police handed out face masks to commuters as part of a national strategy. However, even at rush hour, use of Madrid's transport system was much lower than normal. Antonio Álvarez, a self-employed manual worker, described it as a relief to be able to resume work on the digging of a swimming pool on a private property near the capital. I think the restrictions so far have worked. If they hadn't implemented them it would have been disastrous, he said. Easter is a major holiday in the Spanish calendar, usually packed with religious events and marking the beginning of a busy tourist season. But this year, for the first time since the 1930s, there were no Easter processions and bars, restaurants, beaches and squares across the country were empty. As an alternative, some churches streamed Catholic Mass into the homes of worshippers, while websites replayed footage of religious processions from previous years. Italy reported 431 new deaths on Sunday - the lowest for more than three weeks. However, the country is almost certain to join the United States on Monday with a death toll of more than 20,000. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said last week that the lockdown would continue until 3 May, but that a few types of shops and businesses would be allowed to reopen on Tuesday. They would include bookshops, stationers and shops selling children's clothes, he said. Factories will not reopen, although Mr Conte said he would continue to assess the trend of new infections and act accordingly if conditions allowed it. In Germany, where 3,022 people with Covid-19 have died, pressure is also growing from businesses for a plan on how to exit the country's lockdown. On Wednesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel will discuss a strategy with regional leaders. Elsewhere in Europe, the number of people who have died with the virus in the Netherlands rose by 86 to 2,823 on Monday. The total number of cases increased by almost 1,000 to 26,551. And in France, which is expected to extend its lockdown until 10 May, police said dozens of worshippers defied the measures to attend a secret Easter Mass on Saturday. A priest was fined while other churchgoers were given a warning, the AFP news agency reports."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52265989,Coronavirus: Six people shot at California house party during lockdown,"Californian police say six people have been shot and injured at a large party despite the stay at home order in place in the US state. The shooting took place on Friday night at an apartment complex in Bakersfield, the local sheriff's office says. The victims - four women, one man and a girl - were treated for non-life threatening injuries. No arrests have been made but four men, seen fleeing in a car, are suspected of carrying out the attack. An investigation is under way, Kern County Sheriff's Department says. Sweeping travel restrictions have been in place since last month in California, which is grappling with one of the worst outbreaks of coronavirus in America. As of 11 April, the state reported 21,794 cases and 651 fatalities. Under an order by Governor Gavin Newsom, residents can only leave their homes to buy groceries and medicine, walk a dog or exercise. Non-essential businesses have also been forced to close - others including grocery stores, pharmacies and petrol stations can remain open."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52264860,Coronavirus: Fauci says US 'could have saved lives' with earlier action,"The US could have saved lives if it had introduced measures to stop Covid-19 earlier, a top health official says. If we had, right from the beginning, shut everything down, it may have been a little bit different, Dr Anthony Fauci told CNN, but added that making that decision had been complicated. The US has recorded over 555,000 virus cases and 22,000 deaths so far. President Donald Trump later signalled his disproval with the interview by sharing a tweet about firing Dr Fauci. Dr Fauci has become the public face of the US fight against the outbreak, appearing alongside Mr Trump at the White House's daily updates. But the two have openly differed on several issues, Mr Fauci pointing out in a recent CBS interview that he takes a scientific approach while Mr Trump comes from a hope, layperson standpoint. Mr Trump retweeted a post on Sunday from former Republican congressional hopeful Deanna Lorraine. Fauci was telling people on February 29th that there was nothing to worry about and it posed no threat to the US public at large, it said. Time to #FireFauci... The Trump administration has issued social distancing guidance that lasts until 30 April, but there are questions over when restrictions should be lifted. When asked about a New York Times report that Dr Fauci and other officials had suggested aggressive mitigation towards the end of February, Dr Fauci said health officials could only make recommendations from a pure health standpoint. Often, the recommendation is taken. Sometimes, it's not. But it is what it is, we are where we are right now. Dr Fauci, who is leading the US response to coronavirus, added that no one is going to deny that logically, earlier mitigation could have saved lives. But he said what goes into those kinds of decisions is complicated. There was a lot of pushback about shutting things down back then. We make a recommendation, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, when asked by @JakeTapper about reports that he and other top officials called for social distancing in February. Often the recommendation is taken. Sometimes it's not. But it is what it is. We are where we are right now. pic.twitter.com/sw8xYZILB4 End of Twitter post by @CNNSotu The top doctor also acknowledged that multiple factors were involved with the current situation in the US, such as the nation's size and heterogeneity, not just a later start on mitigation. But he also said parts of the nation might be able to begin a slow return to normalcy at least in some ways, maybe next month. You don't want to do something precipitously, Dr Fauci emphasised, noting that ending virus containment efforts too hastily could lead to a rebound. It's going to be depending on where you are in the country, the nature of the outbreak you already experienced and the threat of an outbreak you may not have experienced. Dr Fauci was also hopeful that the US presidential election, slated for 3 November, would still take place - if the nation takes a measured approach to lessening restrictions. The president's retweet, seen as a signal of his frustration with Dr Fauci, came alongside other tweets from him criticising the media over its coverage of his administration's response to the coronavirus outbreak. In recent days the president has also been critical of the World Health Organization, as he continues to face mounting pressure over both the outbreak and the severe economic disruption it is causing. New York has become the epicentre of the fight against coronavirus in the US. The state has almost 190,000 cases and has seen more than 9,000 deaths - among the highest rates in the world. During a briefing on Sunday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he wanted his state to open as soon as possible. But the governor was cautious, saying there had to be a co-ordinated approach between neighbouring states, more testing availability and additional federal funding. Mr Cuomo was also sceptical of any forecasting, saying: Every informed projection by experts, by the way, has not turned out correct. That was good news, he noted, as it meant policies and social compliance had made a difference in the last few weeks. I've said from day one - all these predictions, we're gonna open businesses in May, do this in May, do this in June - I think that's all premature. I don't think anybody can make an informed decision right now. Mr Cuomo said the number of deaths were stabilising, albeit at a terribly high rate - 758 people lost their lives in the last 24 hours. The death toll has remained in the 700s for the last few days. The White House remains keen to ease social distancing guidelines, and 1 May is a target date, according to food and drug agency commissioner Dr Stephen Hahn. Dr Hahn told ABC News on Sunday, We see light at the end of the tunnel. The decision to change restrictions would be ultimately driven by safety and welfare considerations, he added. Experts, including Dr Hahn, say increasing testing will be key to reopening the country, though Mr Trump has minimised the need for widespread testing. New York's Mr Cuomo and New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy have both called for more tests to stay ahead of the virus. On Sunday, Mr Cuomo announced an executive order calling for more antibody testing in order to determine who might have Covid-19 immunity and could return to work. The questions over when the US might relax its containment efforts come as the states continue to grapple with the spread of the virus. White House Deputy Press Secretary Judd Deere announced President Donald Trump had issued a major disaster declaration for Wyoming on Saturday, meaning all 50 states have those declarations in effect for the first time in history."

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-52228423,Why does President Trump want to mine on the Moon?,"President Trump wants the United States to start mining on the Moon for minerals. The US president recently signed an executive order stating America has the right to explore and use resources from outer space. The order also said the US did not see space as a common area for resources, and didn't need permission of international agreements to get started. But why does he want to mine in space? And what are the benefits? Radio 1 Newsbeat has been speaking to a couple of experts who can fill us in. According to Sarah Cruddas, mining the Moon will help humans travel further in space, to places like Mars. Sarah's a space journalist and says the Moon can become an intergalactic petrol station - because it has the resources needed for rocket fuel - like hydrogen and oxygen. Having a petrol station in space means rockets can travel further into space before worrying about running out of fuel. It's like not taking a kitchen sink when you go on holiday. We shouldn't need to take everything with us when we go into space, Sarah tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. Exploring deeper is important because space has lots of resources which can be used to benefit our planet. Professor Benjamin Sovacool says the world is moving towards renewable energy sources because of climate change and needs those resources. We are currently depleting the resources we have, Benjamin tells Newsbeat. Benjamin is professor of energy policy at University of Sussex and says mining more materials in space can help build items such as electric cars - which will be good for the environment in the long-term. Metals such as lithium or cobalt - which you need - are mainly in places like China, Russia or Congo. And it's difficult to get them. He says it can be complicated trying to source materials from different suppliers around the world, all of which have different rules. Mining on the Moon, with one entity, might be easier, he adds. Sarah says mining those materials on Earth in places like Congo, is done in horrible conditions. But Benjamin does warn that in space mining doesn't offer a short-term fix for climate change on earth. One of the reasons behind President Trump's decision to mine on the Moon could be a lack of access to minerals for the US compared with other parts of the world. The US has lost the race - other countries are ahead, like China and Russia, says Benjamin. Materials mined by China have been made available around the world. It will be really attractive to people like President Trump if you are able to get minerals in a place where the Chinese aren't - like space. There has been tension between the US and China since President Trump came to power, and Benjamin says this is a chance for him to assert dominance and leadership. President Trump's order is clear that international law won't apply to US efforts in space - but laws about what humans can do off-planet are less well defined. Space law is developing, it's something that will change over time, Sarah says. No country can claim to own the Moon, but currently it's like maritime law: If you go there, find it and mine it - it's yours to keep. Benjamin says setting our sights on outer space may be inevitable because of climate change happening here on our planet. One of the arguments people make is space is the only place left to go because we'll eventually mess up our Earth so much, he says. That viewpoint demands space exploration as the only viable alternative for the future of humanity. According to Sarah, the technology is there and progress is fast because there are more private companies involved. Before, it was always government funded. But with private companies and individuals, there's more money and ambition, she tells Newsbeat. We're going to see huge advances on things like mining on the Moon, mining asteroids and the sea, and humans visiting Mars. That's all feasible within our lifetime. But Benjamin says it's also important to use technological developments on existing mining processes on Earth. Lunar mining is at the top of the pyramid, it's really hard to reach, he says. So first develop existing mines, such as gas and deep-water mining. After that, you can go to the next level up. He feels lunar mining is at least 10 to 15 years away, and its future will even then be very dependent on other factors such as money and resource. Ultimately, though, Sarah says it's all a part of something greater. You look up at the Moon, we're watching the sky. It's all part of being involved in extending humanity beyond Earth.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-52265061,Why next few weeks are critical in India's coronavirus war,"At the weekend, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the next three to four weeks would be critical to prevent the spread of coronavirus in India. Ever since its first case was confirmed on 30 January, India has taken a number of measures to try and combat the coronavirus. It has eased testing eligibility and invoked a draconian 122-year-old colonial-era epidemic diseases law to restrict public gatherings, among other things. Now it is set to extend a strict three-week lockdown - scheduled to end on 15 April - until the end of the month. More than a billion people continue to stay at home and land, rail and air transport remain suspended. There have been some 180,000 tests for the infection so far. Some 4.3% of the samples have tested positive. The contagion has killed 273 people. It has reportedly spread to nearly half of the country's 700-odd districts. Several hotspots have been identified. Global health experts are keenly looking at how India battles the virus. Its dense population, vast geography and weak public health system can easily overwhelm the best efforts to contain the spread of infection. It is something which is worrying a lot of people, a leading virologist told me, insisting on anonymity. It is early days yet in the trajectory of the virus here. In three to four weeks, the picture will be clearer. Economist Shamika Ravi, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who is closely tracking the infection, believes India is not doing badly. She says the number of active cases is doubling every seven days, a slower rate than before. The death rate is still low but rising. Our [infection] growth rate is highly contained despite the fact that we are actively chasing the fire, she told me. Almost all of our testing has been driven by protocol, starting with people with travel history, contact tracing of people in touch with them and so on. The probability of getting more positive cases [from this cohort] would have been much higher. Many are also pointing to the lack of reports about any surge in hospital admissions with influenza like illness and Covid-19 patients, which would hint at a rapid community transmission. But this may well be because of lack of information or weak reporting. A private hospital in the central city of Indore, as I reported, is already seeing a surge of cases and treating more than 140 Covid-19 patients, with nearly a third in critical care. At the weekend the hospital was reporting around 40 fresh cases a day. We thought the transmission was going down, but our case load went up suddenly over two days, Dr Ravi Dosi, a chest specialist, at the hospital, told me. Others like T Jacob John, a retired professor of virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore, believe India must prepare for the worst. I don't think we have yet understood the enormity of the problem that is likely to befall us in the next two months, he told me. For much too long the virus dictated our responses rather than the other way round. Dr John says India's response has been largely evidence-based and reactive when it should have been projection-based and pro-active. India's health ministry has strenuously denied there has been community transmission even as doctors from all over the country say they have been seeing patients with Covid-19 like symptoms from early March. The entire focus seems to on finding evidence of community transmission, It's a tactical error, says Dr John. We all know community transmission is there. Dr Ravi believes that going forward, every week is critical now. Easing the lockdown to prevent an economic meltdown and flattening the curve of the virus will now require more surveillance testing to find out who's infected and who's not. India would then need millions of testing kits and trained manpower to handle the process. Testing is also a highly involved process, which includes ensuring a cold chain for and smooth transport of tens of thousands of samples to the labs. India's resources are finite and capacity is limited. One way to get around this, says Dr Ravi, is pool testing. This involves collecting a number of samples in a tube and testing them with a single real time coronavirus test based on swabbing of the nose and throat, as recommended by the WHO. If the test is negative, all the people tested are negative. If it's positive, every person has to be tested individually for the virus. Pool testing reduces the time needed to test large swathes of the population. If there's no trace of the infection in some districts, then we can open them up for economic activity, says Dr Ravi. Virologists believe that India should also do mass anti-body testing - a finger prick blood test to look for the presence of protective antibodies. The blood test is easier and quicker to scale up than, say administering polio drops for immunisation, which India has successfully done. We need antibody testing as a public health tool rather than a diagnostic tool, says one virologist. We need to identify people who have recovered from the infection and send them back to work because they are no longer at risk. Along with this, India needs to look at plasma therapy, virologists I spoke to said. This involves using blood with consent from patients who have successfully fought the infection. This antibody-rich blood plasma can be infused into sick patients. Many doctors say it is a hopeful milestone' in treating the disease. Most virologists I spoke to are unanimous that India should be testing much, much more. Ideally, one of them told me, any person with any upper respiratory tract infection should be eligible for a test. India doesn't have a culture of testing for infectious diseases because most citizens cannot afford them. Risk mitigation is not ingrained in the culture. We tend to treat instead of testing. We rely on medical signs and symptoms [of a disease] rather than the cause or set of causes of a disease or condition, a virologist observed. We do tests only when we are sick. It is all right, says Dr John, that the government is fighting the war on the virus with the might of its administrative muscle. But that might be not enough. Many complain that beyond motivational appeals by the prime minister and routine briefings by bureaucrats, information around the transmission of the virus and scale of testing has been often opaque and evasive. Wearing masks was made mandatory only last week. With its excellent public health system and response, only the southern state of Kerala appears to have flattened the curve so far. This is going to be a long haul. We can't be treating India as one episode of flattening the curve and be done with it. The virus doesn't lose virulence, says a virologist. And all the states are not going to see a rise and fall in the curve at the same time. The weeks ahead will possibly tell us whether India will face an exponential rise in infections or begin to flatten the curve. This is a thousand-piece jigsaw puzzle. There are not going to be any easy answers, says Dr John."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52260748,"Loans scheme must work faster, government admits","Business Secretary Alok Sharma has admitted that more money needs to go out faster to businesses applying for emergency loans from the government. He said 4,200 loans, worth a total of £800m, had been given to firms seeking cash to survive the coronavirus crisis. However, that is just 1.4% of the 300,000 enquiries that are thought to have been made through the scheme. Mr Sharma said banks were working at pace to issue the loans, which are backed by the government. They've got people working over the weekend talking to customers, making sure that they can process these loans as quickly as possible, he told BBC One's Andrew Marr show. But the former Bank of England governor, Mervyn King, later expressed worries about how few businesses had got money through the scheme. Speaking to Sophy Ridge on Sky News, Mr King said the survival of businesses through the crisis was key to a quick economic recovery. The economy will recover quickly only if we can keep the businesses that existed at the beginning of it still functioning and still able to pick up the reins when the epidemic is over, he said. If we find so few business loans being granted, something has gone wrong. Mr King said it was a mistake to close local bank branches that could have been able to function - with social distancing - to respond to the queries and claims of business trying to apply for coronavirus business interruption loans. Earlier this month, the government overhauled the scheme in response to claims that banks were taking advantage of the crisis. Following criticism from firms and MPs, the government banned banks from asking company owners to guarantee loans with their own savings or property when borrowing up to £250,000. It also removed a requirement that businesses must have been refused a loan on commercial terms in order to be eligible for the scheme after firms complained of facing interest rates of up to 30% and being asked to make unreasonable personal guarantees. Mr Sharma told the BBC that the changes to the scheme would make it more attractive. But he said there would no doubt be economic repercussions following the lockdown measures. I think it is absolutely vital we put the support in now so that, when we come out the other side, business are able to start very quickly."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52264546,Record deal to cut oil output ends price war,"Opec producers and allies have agreed a record oil deal that will slash global output by about 10% after a slump in demand caused by coronavirus lockdowns. The deal, agreed on Sunday via video conference, is the largest cut in oil production ever to have been agreed. Opec+, made up of oil producers and allies including Russia, announced plans for the deal on 9 April, but Mexico resisted the cuts. Opec has yet to announce the deal, but individual nations have confirmed it. The only detail to have been confirmed so far is that 9.7 million barrels per day will be cut by Opec oil producers and allies. On Monday in Asia, oil rose over $1 a barrel in early trading with global benchmark Brent up 3.9% to $32.71 a barrel and US grade West Texas Intermediate up 6.1% to $24.15 a barrel. Shares in Australia jumped 3.46% led by energy exporters, but Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 1.35% on continued concerns of poor global demand because of the spread of the coronavirus. This is an unprecedented agreement because it's not just between Opec and Opec+... but also the largest supplier in the world which is the US as well as other G-20 countries which have agreed to support the agreement both in reducing production and also in using up some of the surface supply by putting it into storage, Sandy Fielden, director of Oil Research at research firm Morningstar, told the BBC. US President Donald Trump and Kuwait's energy minister Dr Khaled Ali Mohammed al-Fadhel tweeted the news, while Saudi Arabia's energy ministry and Russia's state news agency Tass both separately confirmed the deal on Sunday. By the grace of Allah, then with wise guidance, continuous efforts and continuous talks since the dawn of Friday, we now announce the completion of the historic agreement to reduce production by approximately 10 million barrels of oil per day from members of 'OPEC +' starting from 1 May 2020, wrote Dr al-Fadhel in a tweet. Global oil demand is estimated to have fallen by a third as more than three billion people are locked down in their homes due to the coronavirus outbreak. Prior to that, oil prices slumped in March to an 18-year-low after Opec+ failed to agree cuts. Talks were complicated by disagreements between Russia and Saudi Arabia, but on 2 April oil prices surged after President Trump signalled that he expected the two countries to end their feud. The initial details of the deal, outlined by Opec+ on Thursday, would have seen the group and its allies cutting 10 million barrels a day or 10% of global supply from 1 May. Another five million barrels were expected to be cut by other nations outside the group such as the US, Canada, Brazil and Norway. It said the cuts would be eased to eight million barrels a day between July and December. Then they would be eased again to six million barrels between January 2021 and April 2022. Independent oil market analyst Gaurav Sharma told the BBC that the deal agreed on Sunday was marginally lower, compared to the 10 million barrels per day that was originally announced on Thursday. Mexico had balked at making these production cuts, which delayed the deal being signed off. Then on Friday, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said that Mr Trump had offered to make extra US cuts on his behalf, an unusual offer by the US president, who has long railed against Opec. Mr Trump said Washington would help Mexico by picking up some of the slack and being reimbursed later, but he did not detail how the arrangement would work. Now a rehashed deal placating Mexico has resurfaced to calm the market, yet, look closer and the doubts surface, Mr Sharma said. The bulk of the output cuts are predicated on Russia and Saudi Arabia cutting 2.5 million barrels per day from agreed - and somewhat inflated - levels of 11 million barrels per day. More importantly, for most of 2019, Russia displayed very poor form in complying with previously agreed Opec+ cuts. So the market is unlikely to take the announced cut at face value. He added that forecasts for a drop in demand in the summer appear to be dire, with even the most optimistic forecasts pointing to a reduction of 18.5 million barrels per day. Mr Sharma said: The announcement can stem the bleeding, but cannot prevent what is likely to be a dire summer for oil producers with the potential to drag oil prices below $20 (£16; €18)."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52189281,Coronavirus: Huawei urges UK not to make 5G U-turn after pandemic,"Chinese telecoms company Huawei has said that disrupting its involvement in the rollout of 5G would do Britain a disservice. In January, the UK government approved a limited role for Huawei in building the country's new data networks. But in March, a backbench rebellion within the Conservative party signalled efforts to overturn the move. In an open letter, the firm also said it was focused on keeping the UK connected during the Covid-19 crisis. But the pandemic may increase pressure on the government to take a tougher line on the company. In the letter, Huawei's UK chief Victor Zhang says home data use has increased by at least 50% since the virus first hit the UK, placing significant pressure on telecoms systems. Huawei says it has been working with partners like BT, Vodafone and EE to deal with the growth and has also set up three new warehouses around the country to ensure spare parts stay in supply. Mr Zhang also says the current crisis has highlighted how many people, especially in rural communities, are stuck in a digital slow lane. And he warns that excluding Huawei from a future role in 5G would be a mistake. There are those who choose to continue to attack us without presenting any evidence, he writes. Disrupting our involvement in the 5G rollout would do Britain a disservice. The government has banned Huawei from the most sensitive parts of the UK's mobile networks, and limited it to 35% of the periphery, which includes its radio masts. But critics argue it is a security risk to allow the Chinese company to play any role at all because of fears it could be used by Beijing to spy on or even sabotage communications. In early March, 38 Conservatives MPs rebelled on the issue, a larger number than expected. That points to a potential upset when the Telecoms Infrastructure Bill comes before Parliament, which is planned to happen later in the year. The coronavirus crisis highlights the tension between economic and national security issues that makes the topic so contentious. On one side is the need for greater connectivity to boost economic growth. Supporters of Huawei's role argue that excluding it would both slow down and raise the cost of delivering faster and more reliable networks. On the other side is anger directed at China from some quarters because of its perceived mishandling of the initial Covid-19 outbreak, as well as the wider concerns over growing dependence on its technologies and companies. Unnamed ministers and senior officials were recently quoted as saying there would have to be a reckoning once the current crisis is over. Part of that could involve a reversal of January's decision - a concern which may explain the decision to write the letter. On 4 April a group of 15 Conservative MPs called for a rethink on relations with China in their own letter to the Prime Minister, written a day before he was admitted to hospital. Over time, we have allowed ourselves to grow dependent on China and have failed to take a strategic view of Britain's long-term economic, technical and security needs, the group wrote. Among the signatories were Iain Duncan Smith, David Davis and Bob Seely. It is understood that Huawei waited until the Prime Minister was out of hospital before releasing its letter."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52199185,Coronavirus: What's happening to the beer left in pubs?,"Pubs, like other public venues, look set to stay shut for the foreseeable future. But what's going to happen to the contents of their cellars? Fifty million pints - give or take. That's the amount of beer expected to go unused in barrels if pubs remain closed into the summer because of coronavirus. Publicans are currently unable to sell their lagers, ales and ciders - save for takeaways and home deliveries. It's a very sad waste of all the work and talent that goes into producing great beer, says Tom Stainer, chief executive of the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra). People won't get to drink it and all those resources have been used up for nothing. Mr Stainer estimates the UK's 39,000 pubs have, on average, 15 barrels in their cellar at any given time. Most are kegs containing 11 gallons (88 pints) each - although many real ales come in nine-gallon (72-pint) casks. The best-before dates on pasteurised beer - including most lagers - are usually three to four months after delivery. Those for real ales and other unpasteurised beer are usually set at six to nine weeks. So most stock could go to waste if social distancing measures remain in place for several months. Keris De Villiers, landlady of the Ram Inn, the Old Sergeant and the Pig and Whistle in Wandsworth, south-west London, says barrelled beer worth about £10,000 could go off in her cellars - while 1,000 litres (1,760 pints) more beer remains in vats at the SlyBeast microbrewery she and husband Lee have recently set up. We could do takeaways, she says, but that would mean selling beer on the corner of a very small pavement. That wouldn't be socially responsible, with the need for people to keep their distance from one another. The whole situation is heart-breaking. Our brewer literally talks to his tanks when he's at work every day. People really care about the beer they're making. It's a craft and people are passionate about it. Supermarket alcohol sales increased by more than a fifth last month as pubs - along with cafes and restaurants - closed on 20 March. People are missing these things in their lives, says Mr Stainer. It's not the biggest issue that the country is dealing with, but aspects of life like going to the cinema or cafe, or going for a pint, are something we treasure. Many breweries and distributors have offered to take back barrels at no charge once the lockdown is over, taking some of the financial pressure off landlords. Iain Crockett, director of Gloucestershire-based Severn Brewing, says draymen - people who deliver beer - face the worst week of their lives when the pub trade returns, having to lift full barrels - rather than empties - out of cellars. He wants there to be at least a couple of weeks' notice before pubs are allowed to reopen. All the little brewers are going to be completely shafted otherwise, Mr Crockett says. While the big brewers have large storage capacities, small operators will be starting more from scratch, he adds. Before that, though, there's the question of how to get rid of tens of millions of pints. Can we expect scenes like those following the introduction of Prohibition in the US a century ago, where bottles and barrels were smashed, their contents poured away? Probably not. In the US, bar owners have been told not to tip out-of-date beer down storm drains, because it's illegal and environmentally damaging. Some UK publicans, have, however, already resorted to this. The British Institute of Innkeeping is advising against such action, amid concern it could leave landlords further out of pocket. Under Treasury rules, when publicans get rid of large amounts of spoilt beer, duty doesn't need to be paid on it. Brewery representatives normally oversee this process, but because of social distancing they can't visit premises at the moment. The government has temporarily allowed brewers to appoint publicans to oversee the dumping of beer. But they must keep a proper record of it, including perhaps filming a video as proof it's been destroyed, rather than put aside for profit. One option that publicans and brewers who spoke to the BBC would love to try is converting out-of-date beer into hand sanitiser, by extracting the alcohol. Independent brewer Brewdog is already making hand sanitiser at its Aberdeenshire premises, while the government is giving manufacturers who want to do the same priority access to the methylated spirits - or denatured alcohol - they need. Despite these difficult times, Mrs De Villiers says pub owners and tenants are doing all we can to survive and assist the community. The breweries are helping us and they want us to survive, she adds. Everyone's ready to help everyone else. In an effort to limit the economic damage caused by coronavirus, the government has offered £330bn in loans, £20bn in other aid, a business rates holiday, and grants for retailers and pubs. Pubs are at the heart of our communities and an important part of local economies, says a spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. We've asked them to temporarily close in order to help protect people and reduce the spread of the virus. But we are also delivering support to help businesses, including pubs, through the coronavirus pandemic."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52211205,Coronavirus: Food delivery driver paying back doctors who saved him,"Doctors and nurses are people who saved me from cancer and gave me strength in the darkest time. I need to return the favour, says Li Yan, a food delivery rider based in Beijing. Mr Li was diagnosed with lymph cancer in 2003, when he was just 17 years old. He recovered from the disease and has been full of gratitude ever since for the medical workers who nursed him back to health. With China in a national lockdown, food delivery firms found themselves in hot demand providing meals for residents stuck at home to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. As a delivery rider for Meituan, one of China's biggest food delivery firms, Mr Li saw an opportunity to repay the medical professionals he admires by providing them with food and drinks as they worked tirelessly on patients across the city. Given my past experience, I felt I needed to do something for them in return during the virus outbreak, he adds. Beijing is a city of 21 million residents, and Mr Li covers its Tongzhou district, where there are a handful of hospitals with fever clinics, one of which is a designated hospital for Covid-19 treatment. Many might have concerns delivering for the hospital, but I've chosen to deliver for them more often. I just think of the local residents and medical workers who need us. I can't leave them being hungry. It's not for money. Before the outbreak in China, he delivered more than 50 orders on an average day. But during the first ten days after the coronavirus outbreak in late January, the number of orders dropped to less than 20, as some restaurants were closed. The outbreak also coincided with the Chinese New Year period which is normally a low season. By mid-February when the situation was brought more under control, and people's concerns and fears gradually began to ease, orders started to be restored. I can deliver over 40 orders a day now. During this time, Meituan brought in a contactless delivery option which allowed food to be dropped off at designated points to avoid contact between customers and riders. When I called customers to explain, some initially didn't understand and wanted to cancel the order. But gradually people grew more understanding and began to welcome the contactless approach. China was in lockdown for more than two months, although restrictions are now beginning to be lifted. It will still take time before a sense of normalcy returns. I remember when the coronavirus first broke out, it was hazy for a few days in Beijing. Streets were empty and stores were closed. An ambulance or a delivery rider occasionally drove by. It felt like I was living in a different world. Mr Li says restaurants have started to re-open and people have begun coming back to work in the office since mid-February. Orders are still lower than normal but are improving. I miss the hustling Beijing which used to filled with traffic, the days when I could smell car exhaust when I stop at crossroads, the times when I had to walk all the way up to the 6th floor to deliver food, and even times when I was late for a delivery. When the virus first broke out, face masks and alcohol disinfectant were the most ordered items along with supermarket groceries. Grains, rice, cooking oil, vegetables, fruits, and solid, packaged food that lasts long. Orders often came in big sizes and transaction prices at around 200 yuan [£23; $28] to 300 yuan on one order. Being a food delivery rider, Mr Li feels he can not only give back to the medical community but to the city's vulnerable too. I once received an order that came with a note saying the customer is a 82-year-old who lives alone and couldn't get downstairs to pick up the food so the rider needs to enter the residential community and deliver food to the door. I had to spend some time communicating with security and finally was allowed in. The door was open when I arrived, and I put the bowl of wontons [a type of dumpling] on the table. Tips have increased from happy customers during the pandemic as a result. Many more send me thank-you notes in the Meituan app and tell me to take care. Mr Li has a new routine now which involves lots of disinfecting and temperature checks. I get my temperature checked dozens of times everyday now, before entering shopping malls, at restaurants, and returning home to the residential compound I live in. I also bring with me disinfectant sprays, a towel in my scooter and use disposable gloves when delivering to areas with reported confirmed cases. While he's providing a vital service, is Mr Li worried about the risk of infection? I did have worries when the virus spread and was at its worst time here but I feel like I've already been there, given what I went through in the fight against cancer. I've learnt to take things easy, look at the bright side of things and always seek strength in a dark time. As long as I take sufficient precautions, masks, gloves, disinfectants and everything, and follow advice from disease control experts, I think the possibility of getting the virus is pretty low. And with a seven-month pregnant wife at home, Mr Li is looking forward to happier times."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52267117,World Bank warns South Asia's economic growth to slump,"South Asia faces its worst economic performance in 40 years because of the coronavirus, the World Bank has said. The effects will unravel decades of progress in the region's battle against poverty. Economies such as India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan have reported relatively few virus cases but experts fear they could be the next hotspots. The South Asia region is home to 1.8 billion people and some of the world’s most densely populated cities. South Asia finds itself in a perfect storm of adverse effects. Tourism has dried up, supply chains have been disrupted, demand for garments has collapsed and consumer and investor sentiments have deteriorated, said the World Bank report. It has slashed its growth forecast for the region this year to 1.8% to 2.8% from its original projection of 6.3% made before the virus outbreak. At least half the countries in this region could fall into deep recession. The worst hit economy will be the Maldives, a nation of small islands in the Arabian Sea where the collapse of high-end tourism could see its economic output shrink by as much as 13%, warned the World Bank. India, the biggest economy in South Asia, could see growth of just 1.5% in its financial year, down from a figure of around 5%, the World Bank predicted. It has advised governments to ramp up action to curb the health emergency, protect their people, especially the poorest and most vulnerable, and set the stage now for fast economic recovery. The World Bank also recommended temporary work programmes for migrant workers, and debt relief for businesses and individuals while cutting red tape on essential imports and exports. Last week the Washington DC-based lender said it would deploy up to $160bn (£128bn) in financial support over the next 15 months to help vulnerable countries deal with the pandemic and bolster their economic recovery."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51837296,Drones in Africa: How they could become lifesavers,"Death comes fast, says Temie Giwa-Tubosun, as we sit in the scorching sunshine of Rwanda's capital Kigali. She's talking about post-partum haemorrhage - women bleeding after childbirth. I'm always amazed that more attention isn't paid to this - it's the biggest cause of death in childbirth. Temie's company, Lifebank, delivers life-saving blood to hospitals in her home country of Nigeria, and elsewhere on the continent. Usually the blood is transported by road or on boats, but in Ethiopia some is moved by drone. Mr Giwa-Tubosun is visiting Kigali for the first ever African Drone Forum at the shiny convention centre, which looks like a giant beehive crossed with a helter-skelter. It glows like a rainbow at night, and is the jewel in the crown of modern Kigali, the fast-changing capital of a country which Rwanda's politicians time and again tell us is open for business. Technology is front and centre of the government's plan to become a higher-middle-income country by 2050. It's an ambitious goal, given over 35% of the population lives in poverty, according to government statistics. But it's one which President Paul Kagame is clearly keen to push. As he stands in front of the audience, he says that drones will become not just part of the Rwandan skies - he wants them manufactured and piloted by Rwandans. More Technology of Business Schoolchildren watching hop up and down with excitement, hands shoot into the air when speakers talk about drone networks. I want to be a drone pilot, one girl, who can't be more than twelve, announces confidently. This is now one of the coolest jobs in Rwanda. In underdeveloped countries like Rwanda technology has to be adopted faster, says one college student called Benjamin. His classmate nods, she's studying engineering too. People don't know about drones, but the young can tell the older generation he adds. Rwanda, the country of a thousand hills and slow, tediously winding roads, was the first in the world to embrace a commercial delivery service by drone when Silicon Valley firm Zipline began flying blood in 2016. It received a huge amount of global publicity and has delivered tens of thousands of units of blood. But Zipline is an exception. Its flights are classified as government flights, meaning it has high-level exemptions when it comes to air traffic management. It's the thorny issue of regulation and management of the lower airspace which all agree is key to the establishment of sustainable long-term drone delivery networks. Why drone deliveries? Temie explains how her drivers have to learn the location of 400 hospitals by heart as the maps aren't accurate enough in a frantically urbanising city like Lagos, which is also clogged by traffic. Drones for her are just a way to get what's needed to patients faster. But, in Nigeria, they're not yet used for drops. The regulation isn't there yet, she says, but she and most people here believe that this will change, and that African skies, which are less congested than many parts of the world, will lead the way. But can it happen as quickly as many seem impatient to see, and should it? Freddie Mbuya, who owns the Tanzanian technology firm Uhurulabs, is a self-confessed nay-sayer. I don't think that delivery drones in Africa will be realistic in any meaningful way for the next decade. There's humanitarian need but no market opportunity. It exists now because of donor money and sponsorship. For him, and his company, drones for mapping, and land surveying for clients such as miners are the most compelling use case. The World Bank's Edward Anderson, who has focused on drones in the region, argues that they should be regarded as useful not just for medical deliveries. Rwanda is one of the most densely populated rural parts of the world. In the long run we're looking at drones providing economic opportunity in agriculture, for small-scale manufacturers, and to deliver time-sensitive goods such as cash and documents. Leapfrogging slow roads A 90km drive from Kigali, taking over four-and-a-half stomach-churning hours, we arrive at a temporary drone port in a stunning spot by a bay of Lake Kivu, close to the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo. Rwanda's rural areas are densely populated, but road infrastructure is inadequate. Most people walk miles up steep, high-sided hills, and the main road out of Kigali has a constant stream of foot traffic. The lake is quiet, and still. A local fisherman tells us that's because of strict restrictions due to the neighbouring country's ongoing Ebola outbreak. The army says no, he says bluntly when we ask why there are so few boats, which would be a lot faster than roads to transport goods. This is the Lake Kivu Challenge, the competition portion of the drone forum, and teams from around the world, mainly from Europe, are competing for contracts with the Rwandan government. In a shed next to the hut where the little drones sit ready for their turn, we see mock-ups of blood transfusion bags and medical samples. These will be picked up by the drones, dropped at a nearby island, then collected again within a certain time limit. Sheltering in the shade we chat to Selina Herzog from German drone firm Wingcopter. It received a lot of attention last year for its vaccine drops on a remote island in Vanuatu in the Pacific. We have to make sure we aren't just coming into a country, running a short trial, then leaving again, she says. Who will pay for the drones? This has been one of the biggest criticisms of cargo drone experiments, funded more often than not by humanitarian agencies for a very short duration. We're not there yet with regulators, countries have different rules, we have a lot to work out still.... and the question is, just who is going to pay for this? Ms Herzog asks. This is something Lifebank's Temie Giwa is also passionate about. We have a moral responsibility to be cost-effective. We can't charge a developing country $250 (£204) for a drone delivery. [However] the only way to be sustainable is to be profitable. Back in Kigali, Temie remembers her own emergency caesarean, while she was in the US. She believes the outcome could have been tragically different if she'd been back home in Nigeria, as it is for so many women. I get tearful every time I think about this, it is so solvable."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52242406,"Coronavirus: 'I lost my job, now we're on the bare minimum'","I've applied for universal credit, I got a mortgage holiday, I am applying for a council tax deferral, but it won't be enough, says Junior Stewart, 45, from Luton. The five of us are on the bare minimum, I don't know how we'll get by. Junior is one of the many now struggling because they do not qualify for emergency government support offered to workers affected by the coronavirus outbreak. Two weeks ago he lost his new sales job because he had not been there long enough to be furloughed or put on state-paid leave, having started after 28 February. As he was previously self-employed, he couldn't ask an old employer to furlough him. And he says there is no freelance work to go back to. Making things tougher, Junior's wife had a baby boy in February and is only getting half her normal salary while on maternity leave. We won't have enough to pay for our gas and electric, our car repayments, he says. On top of those expenses, the couple also have three kids to feed. I thought about getting a job at a supermarket but don't want to bring the virus home, Junior explains. You have to put on a brave face for the kids, but it is a stressful time. As large parts of the economy have been shut down to battle Covid-19, the government has provided a huge package of support for those who have lost their jobs or income. Millions should benefit but some have not been able to get help because they don't meet the strict eligibility criteria, or were laid off. Cheryl Carroll, 39, from South East London is self employed but cannot access the SEISS scheme, which would let her claim a taxable grant worth 80% of her trading profits, up to £2,500 per month for three months. The events director has only worked for herself for 16 months, which means she does not have accounts going back further than 2019. This means she is unable to fulfil a government requirement for support. All events have been stopped and I have no income coming in, she says. I applied for universal credit but it will take at least five weeks, and from what I can gather, it will only be £75 a week. Cheryl got a three month mortgage holiday from the bank and lives alone, with no dependents. But she is using her savings to pay her outgoings and fears she won't have enough left to pay her next tax bill when it's due. It's a worrying time and I feel a bit abandoned by the government, she says. Cheryl says she could sell her house if things got really bad, but she does not want to. There are five million self-employed people in the UK and the government says 95% will be eligible for emergency support. But research from the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed suggests 45% of self-employed workers think they won't have enough money to cover basic costs during the crisis, despite the help on offer. That includes directors of small limited companies, who take their income fully or partially in dividends, which the government will not cover. Michelle Donald, 41, says turnover at the small recruitment company she runs with her husband in Norfolk dropped to virtually zero overnight when the crisis hit. Whilst we are lucky in the sense that our overheads are small, the lack of support from the government for our personal income is what will ruin us, the company director says. Because she pays herself a small basic salary alongside her dividends, she will be able to furlough herself and claim 80% of that income - about £800 a month. But her husband can't do the same, as he has to continue his duties to try to keep business afloat. We are not wealthy by any stretch. We have three kids in the house and our monthly outgoings will be about £1,500 a month if we get a mortgage holiday, says Michelle. We have a little bit of savings but it's all we have got. If we have to use those, we will come out of this with literally not a penny to our name. She thinks company directors have been discriminated against because people think they don't pay as much tax and national insurance, when in fact the difference is minimal. She and her husband also put lots of their own money into building the business ,which could very well go under. A petition urging the government to cover dividend income through the coronavirus job retention scheme has been signed by 320,000 people. A Treasury spokeswoman said: The chancellor has outlined an unprecedented package of measures to protect millions of people's jobs and incomes as part of the national effort in response to coronavirus. Those who do not qualify for the support schemes will be able to access a range of other measures - including an increase in the universal credit allowance, income tax deferrals, £1bn more support for renters and access to three-month mortgage holidays."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52200386,Coronavirus: Six industries crying out for help,"As the coronavirus pandemic continues, more and more sectors of the economy are feeling the strain. And with banks under fire for denying emergency loans to some firms, it's hardly surprising that the UK's government is facing more calls for direct intervention. The list covers big chunks of the country's infrastructure and vital transport links, but also other, less obvious economic areas that are no less important to society. But all of them have one thing in common: they fear that the coronavirus crisis will inflict lasting damage on them. The aviation industry was one of the first sectors to petition the government for a bailout. As country after country has imposed restrictions on travel in a bid to halt the spread of the virus, airlines have been seeking state aid to avoid going out of business for good. At the end of last month, a group of 38 MPs wrote to Chancellor Rishi Sunak urging him to take steps to support airlines during the coronavirus pandemic. The move was backed by the airline industry, with Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, saying: We are now entering the danger zone, and we urge government to change tack and start to engage on a sector-wide basis before it's too late. Virgin Atlantic, for one, has indicated that it intends to ask for a government bailout worth hundreds of millions of pounds. But so far, Mr Sunak has said airlines should find other forms of funding and not turn first to the government. Other forms of transport are also facing tough times because of coronavirus. The road haulage industry, which moves goods from warehouses to shops across the country, is the latest to seek more help from the government. Richard Burnett, chief executive of the Road Haulage Association, told the BBC's Today programme that he was hopeful about the prospect of aid. Government are definitely recognising how critical and how important we are, he said. We are keeping the country fed at the moment. But for one haulier, Andrew Howard, who owns Peterborough-based PC Howard, financial relief can't come soon enough. He said that because non-essential shops had been closed, the firm was moving fewer goods. We are now moving our lorries only partly loaded, typically two-thirds loaded, he told the Today programme, and that means we are losing money every single day, every time we send a vehicle out. Ferry companies transport people and goods in and out of the UK. But because of the steep drop in passenger numbers, the firms are cutting back on services, putting essential supplies of food and medication at risk. Those suspending their passenger services include P&O Ferries, which carries about 15% of the UK's imported goods, including food and medicines. It is furloughing more than 1,000 staff, using the government's job retention scheme. P&O Ferries told the BBC that the company needs £257m to keep going. The BBC understands the company wants £150m of that to come from the government. Bob Sanguinetti, chief executive of the UK Chamber of Shipping, told the BBC: What we're asking for is not a wholesale bailout, it's for the government to share and underwrite some of the risk and the costs to allow the ferry companies to continue providing that vital, lifeline service to the country. As manufacturers and construction firms shut down their operations, demand for steel has slumped. Industry group UK Steel has said that companies in the sector are fast approaching a cashflow crisis. The lobby group says many steel producers fall outside the scope of existing emergency loan schemes and need more specific help. Richard Warren, UK Steel's head of policy and representation, told the BBC: The key message is one of speed - we are looking for a solution that delivers the liquidity support as quickly as possible. He called on the government to amend and expand its current schemes to ensure steel companies could access the support available. Springtime is here - and in normal times, garden centres would be doing a roaring trade. But with all non-essential shops closed down, all those plants and shrubs can't find their way to the public. That's terrible news for plant growers, who are seeing their assets rot away in front of them. The Horticultural Trades Association (HTA) has warned that up to a third of producers could go bust. It is asking the government for financial assistance of up to £250m to help the industry avoid collapse. Neil Alcock, managing director of Seiont Nurseries in north Wales, told the BBC that the firm had seen a downturn costing it about £100,000 worth of orders. He added: We had sold thousands of plants, but then cancellations came in from everywhere. No ifs, no buts, the whole retail supply chain stopped for us. From food banks to mental health experts, the charitable sector is providing plenty of people with support in these troubled times. But charities themselves are reeling from the financial impact of the crisis, with Oxfam and Age UK furloughing up to 70% of their staff during the coronavirus pandemic. Caron Bradshaw, chief executive of the Charity Finance Group, tweeted that the charity sector needed its own package of support from the government. Please recognise the impact losing charities - big and small - will have on our society, she said, adding that charities were essential to the fight to rebuild after this unprecedented disaster is over. Charities are to society what bees are to the environment. We work away, often in the background, often unnoticed, she said. So what yardstick should the government use when assessing these competing cries for help? Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said that a good rule for government aid should be bailing out people, not bailing out companies. He acknowledged that the airline industry in particular had seen a frightening and spectacular collapse in demand, but added that people would argue that companies should have been prepared for at least some kind of downturn. Maybe you do help companies out, but you do need to get to the point where shareholders and creditors have taken a hit first, he told the BBC. You can't look as though you're bailing out the 1% at the expense of the 99%."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52220020,Coronavirus: The US clothing firms now making gowns and gloves,"In a normal year Michael Rubin's athletic apparel factory in Pennsylvania would be ramping up for the start of baseball season, churning out team uniforms and clothing to sell to fans. Instead his company, Fanatics, has remade itself into a gown and mask manufacturer for hospitals facing shortages of protective gear as they fight the coronavirus. Fanatics isn't alone. Thousands of companies across the US have responded to pleas for help from hospitals facing shortages of critical health supplies. Clothing companies like Gap and Hanes are making gowns and scrubs. Ford and General Motors are repurposing fans and batteries, typically used in cars, to make ventilators. Boeing and Apple are making face shields. Luxury brands, distilleries - even state prisoners - are producing hand sanitiser. We felt it was our responsibility to help pitch in, says Mr Rubin. Firms responding in what he calls this dire time of need aren't necessarily going to profit from the enterprise but they are proving a point: The private sector is famously good at responding nimbly and quickly to changing demands. The shortages in the US are are not unique, nor is the response from the private sector. In the UK, engineering firm Dyson has designed a new ventilator; in France, Chanel is contributing masks; in Germany, Volkswagen and other firms are manufacturing protective equipment. But the White House has been notably hands-off when it comes to establishing any co-ordinated, centralised response, says Nada Sanders, professor of supply chain management at Northeastern University. This has led to a free-for-all, as local governments and hospitals competed to buy products or find donations, scam artists emerged, and prices skyrocketed. The US has allowed pure capitalism to serve as an incentive says Dr Sanders. Companies want to step up to the plate and so many are. I really applaud them, but I also find it even more frustrating because I see the chaos. In the European Union, the shortages were caused by inadequate reserves of equipment, as coronavirus cases surged and shipments from overseas were delayed. But in the US, which has a national stockpile of supplies, including badly-needed ventilators, a slow federal response has added to the problem, says Prashant Yadav, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development and a professor at INSEAD. Outcomes are pretty bad in both [Europe and America], but in one place they don't have large resources in a stockpile. They didn't have a large manufacturing base, he says. Our decision-making wasn't working right or our coordinating mechanisms weren't working right. Converting factories to make basic products like sanitiser or masks isn't necessarily that difficult or expensive. Mr Rubin's factory shipped its first masks within three days and now produces about 10,000 daily. But getting companies to start making machines like ventilators - which have dozens of parts sourced globally - is far more complex and requires government intervention, says Dr Sanders. While some states, including California, have voluntarily sent existing ventilators to virus hotspots like New York, Dr Sanders says a national response is needed, to ensure there is a clear inventory of what's on hand and the ability to shift resources to the places that need it most. This is supply chain 101 ... it's not like it's really that hard, she says. The lack of coordinated national response is really infuriating. Under pressure to act, President Donald Trump has targeted some companies with orders to produce items in high demand and banned exports of medical supplies. Federal health officials also announced a $50m deal with General Motors to produce 30,000 ventilators. But for weeks Mr Trump resisted using the full extent of his authority to compel firms to produce equipment and prioritise deliveries. We're a country not based on nationalising our business, he said last month. Call a person over in Venezuela. Ask them, how did nationalisation of their businesses work out? Not too well. The concept of nationalising our business is not a good concept. New York Senator Chuck Schumer, a leading Democrat, last week called on the president to appoint a national 'czar' to oversee distribution and production. The hunting and pecking isn't working, he told reporters. It is not clear that the president will change tack. Luckily in some places the private sector efforts are coming through. St Luke's University Health Network, which worked with Fanatics to design its masks, now has about 30 days worth of protective gear on hand, says vice president Chad Brisendine. Contributions from non-traditional suppliers account for a quarter or more of that. Between the external, local, non-traditional suppliers, plus the donations, that really helped us, Mr Brisendine says. But the Pennsylvania hospital system has still been forced to introduce new cleaning procedures so it can reuse masks and other equipment more intensively, he adds. Mr Brisendine says he's worried the wider needs are so great, even a stronger federal response wouldn't resolve the problems his health network now faces. I just wonder how fast they can move, he says. When you need it, you needed it yesterday."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52229698,Coronavirus: Ask-a-friend cash access scheme extended,"Anyone who cannot leave home may be able to ask a trusted friend or volunteer to withdraw cash at any Post Office using a single-use voucher. The Post Office scheme is being extended and offered to all banks, building societies and credit unions. If the bank allows it, someone can ask for a one-time barcode sent via text, email or post for a stipulated amount. A trusted friend or volunteer can exchange the voucher for the cash requested. Previously, only a named individual, such as a carer, could collect cash in this way on someone's behalf. Now any trusted neighbour or volunteer can do so. The idea of the Payout Now scheme is to allow people who are shielded or self-isolating, mainly elderly, to maintain access to cash without having to hand over a debit card and Pin to somebody else. They tell their bank exactly how much they want to withdraw from their account, up to a limit set by the bank, and allow a family member, trusted friend or volunteer to collect it on their behalf in exchange for the voucher. Martin Kearsley, banking director at the Post Office, said: Being able to easily access cash is a vital service for older people and those self-isolating. [This] means they can access cash quickly and securely to repay someone for a helpful service like shopping, or simply manage their finances, providing peace of mind that cash can be securely sourced with the help of any trusted helper. A service that allows vulnerable customers to contact their bank and arrange to cash a cheque at a Post Office branch is also being sped up. Under the Fast PACE system, the customer should contact their bank and check they can use the service. They would then write a cheque to The Post Office, print the name on the back of the cheque of the person collecting it for them and sign that side too. That individual can then collect the cash from a Post Office branch after their ID is verified. At its fastest, the whole process from the initial call to the cash being collected could take a day. Anyone collecting cash on behalf of another person must remember to practise safe distancing and should consider arranging with the recipient how the cash can be safely handed over - perhaps through a person's letterbox, for example, Mr Kearsley added. Both schemes come with a warning that people should only use friends and volunteers who are completely trusted, they should only withdraw cash they really need, and they should not be put under any pressure to do so. There have been reports of fraudsters offering to shop for people who cannot leave the home, but who steal any money they are given, or take money from accounts after a Pin is handed over."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52169825,Coronavirus: What’s life like when you're on furlough?,"It really is a bit of a sticking plaster. Yes, you've got 80% of your income, but we don't know how long that's going to last. Although I'm grateful to be in this position - it's unsettling. Olivia Webb works for a recruitment firm. She was put on furlough after her company lost business almost overnight as a result of the coronavirus lockdown. The government pays 80% of her monthly salary (up to £2,500) and she can't work for her company in the meantime. It's not known exactly how many people are in Olivia's position, because the government's online portal for businesses to register their furloughed workers does not open until the end of April. But anecdotally, the numbers are significant and growing. According to the Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development, more than half of UK employers are exploring the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. Natalie Weaving is co-founder of a marketing agency. She volunteered for furlough because she knew not paying her salary would help the business in the long term. I feel terribly guilty for being at home, about being able to home-school without distraction, she says. But I know that because some work has stopped that we don't need a full cohort of staff. I still have my alarm on as if I'm going to work. I try and set myself a couple of goals each day to complete something, a course module for example. I also do a few things that bring me joy, like knitting. Like Natalie, Olivia is trying to make the best of her time off, taking part in online training courses. But losing their role in a business can take its toll on people's mental health. She says she misses work, the daily conference calls and finds it hard not being around people. Human resources expert Michaela Gartside believes keeping in touch with people while they are off work is vital. You have to remember they're sitting at home waiting for the next update, which they hope is: 'Come back to work', she says. Restaurant chain Honest Burgers has put in place a stay connected timetable for the 700 staff they have furloughed. Many of their staff are young, live alone and have family abroad, so this is to tackle some of the boredom but more importantly help with their mental wellbeing as well as their physical wellbeing, according to co-founder Philip Eeles. Many employees want the time off to look after their children now that nurseries and schools are closed. Claire Hastie is slowly recovering from Covid-19. A single mum of three, she was relieved when she volunteered to be put on furlough and her firm accepted the request. You don't want to feel the business can manage without you, but I need to see my children and concentrate on getting better, she says. The company is being amazing towards me, it has reduced me to tears. This is allowed within the latest government guidelines, according to Diane Gilhooley, global head at the law firm Eversheds Sutherland, who points out furloughing people for Covid-19 related caring responsibilities starts to make it look more like an income protection scheme rather than a redundancy avoidance scheme. Though employers around the country have embraced furloughing with enthusiasm, the speed at which it has been introduced has raised a number of issues. Some firms would like to see more flexibility, so they could make some team members part-time, with the government topping up their salary. Other firms would just like more information. Mick Collins runs Secure Archive Solutions outside Manchester which stores and shreds legal documents. He has furloughed four members of staff, leaving him and his wife to run the business. But they feel rather in the dark by gaps in information, hoping - he says - that they're doing things by the book. We cannot do anything concrete until the government website for logging staff details is up and running. Our main thing is keeping the records bang on. Employer or employee, it's the not knowing what might come after the pandemic subsides that is worrying many. As Olivia puts it: Being on furlough is better than losing my job. But we don't know when recruitment will pick up - when confidence will pick up. Natalie says she has to believe everything will go back to business as usual. We know things will be different but I think we will learn good practices by having to adapt to this environment. It is strange times and anyone who's on furlough needs to hold on to the fact that they haven't been laid off and the company is trying to do everything they can to make sure they're not."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52110990,Coronavirus: I play computer games for hours each day,"One of the things I do to lift my spirits is eat, because I can't go out to restaurants. So I reach for the nearest sugary drink and sugary foods like pastries. I'll have a cookie at midnight, or soft drinks for breakfast. Trushar Patel, 33, a photographer from London says he's doing his best to stay healthy during the lockdown but it is really hard. He and his fiancée Deepa Ragwani, 28, usually travel a lot for work. But confined to the house, he says his sense of time has disappeared and he's fallen back on his vices to stay sane. We don't drink alcohol, but I'll watch Netflix until midnight and binge watch YouTube and social media. I play computer games for several hours each day - it used to be once a week. As much as we're encouraged to use this enforced isolation to stay fit, learn a second language or work on creative projects, many of us will also turn to less virtuous pastimes to get through the stressful weeks ahead. Even the government has acknowledged we need that pressure-valve, adding off-licences to the list of essential shops allowed to stay open, after supermarkets found their booze shelves swept bare. There is something about not being able to control a situation, we don't know how this is going to play out. So people might turn to things like alcohol as a coping mechanism, says Lesley Ludlow, a counsellor who chairs the private practice arm of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy. Then there is the boredom. People have had their social lives taken away from them, so they look for a quick fix to make life feel a bit more normal for a while. Perhaps not surprisingly, firms that cater to our private passions seem to be doing quite well, at a time when many others businesses are struggling. Pornhub, a popular adult entertainment website, reported a spike of more than 10% in traffic after it offered free premium access - or what it called an extra incentive to stay at home and flatten the curve. And online betting firm 888 Holdings said this month that its outlook for 2020 wasn't too bad, even though gambling on traditional sports has collapsed along with live fixtures. That is partly because customers are turning to alternative - and some say riskier - games online such as casino and poker. Such things may help while away the time, but the dangers are obvious too, says Ms Ludlow. With no boss or timetable telling you not to drink, smoke or gamble, we're largely reliant on self-moderation. But not everyone has that internal strength, she says. MPs have urged gambling websites to set a £50 limit per day to try to stop people becoming addicted and making financial problems worse. And the World Health Organization has warned that alcohol is an unhelpful coping strategy for the possible stress caused by a coronavirus lockdown. Smoking is another crutch to be wary of, says Deborah Arnott, head of the charity Action on Smoking and Health (Ash). She is working on a Quit for Covid campaign urging smokers to protect their own health and that of those living with them. There's pressure, because you're feeling isolated, to smoke. At the same time, if you get Covid-19 it will take you longer to recover and is likely to lead to more serious impacts, she says. But while some vices will do you more harm than others, others are arguably entirely harmless. Online retailer Sextoys.co.uk and rival Ann Summers both say that demand for toys is up by about 25% since the lockdown began, as people look for ways to spice up the time at home. Brighton-based adult boutique Lust and Taboo also saw a last minute rush from customers stocking up before the shutdown, before it switched to online orders only. We're doing a non-contact drop within the hour, says owner Tim Richardson. He's optimistic the business can get through the lockdown but thinks his High Street shop should have been on the essential retailers list - although not for the reasons you might expect. You can get a high level of admissions into hospital [of people] using things as sex toys that are not designed as a sex toy. We don't want that."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52182509,Will we ever take cruise holidays again?,"David Reece and his wife Carolyn should be sipping cocktails somewhere in the Indian Ocean at the moment. But their latest cruise line holiday has been cancelled because of the coronavirus outbreak. And they are missing it - as confirmed devotees of cruise vacations they have been on nearly 20 over the past two decades. For the retired couple from Plymouth it all started by accident. I was sent to the travel agents to book a cheap holiday in the Canaries, and I came back having booked a cruise in the Red Sea, says David. Carolyn didn't talk to me for two weeks. But they loved it, and ever since they have travelled all over the world on cruise ships; from the Baltic to the Caribbean, and from Australia to Brazil. For them it is the perfect holiday, as David explains: We had the idea it was all about crossing the Atlantic, sitting on deckchairs with a blanket over your knees. [But in reality], the ships are really mobile hotels, and we wake up somewhere different every day… we use it to go to places we want to see. But those floating hotels are now all rapidly returning to port, discharging their passengers and being mothballed. The industry has not just been devastated, it has ceased to function altogether. For it, coronavirus has been the perfect storm. It has gone from being an industry worth $46bn (£37bn) a year, with 26 million passengers per annum, to an almost total standstill overnight. Ironically, the industry was well prepared for the outbreak of disease on board its ships, as it has happened plenty of times before, most often the norovirus vomiting bug. However, this time the plan hit a snag, as Christopher Muller, professor of hospitality at Boston University, explains. The worst thing you can do [if passengers start falling ill] is keep people on board, he says. The plan is to go to the nearest port, get everyone off and then sanitize the ship. Normally this means the ship is ready to start cruising again within a matter of weeks, but this time governments forced them to keep people on board, adds Prof Muller. This was not the industry's fault, they would not normally have done this. The problem was made worse by the fact that many modern cruise liners have relatively small cabins, as the industry's economic model depends on getting as many passengers as possible spending money in the ship's spas, restaurants, bars and shops. The resulting bad publicity, as passengers suffered in quarantine on board ships within sight of the shore, will be difficult for the industry to shake off. So, will this put the industry's rapid expansion in recent years into reverse? The sector certainly has one major problem that means it is likely to suffer more than other parts of the tourism and travel industries such as the airline sector - it has few friends in high places. Most cruise ships are not registered where they do business, in the USA and Europe, but offshore in places like Panama and the Bahamas. The industry does that for two reasons - it saves a fortune in tax, and it means that they don't have to follow American or European labour laws. This allow the companies to recruit cheap workers from developing countries, pay them less, and work them harder. Now, however, avoiding taxes and hiring cheap foreign workers doesn't look so clever - the cruise line industry was specifically not included in the US's business bailout schemes. The industry may be in dire straits, but it is crying in the dark. And even if governments wanted to help, which they don't appear to, as Prof Muller points out: It is hard to give a tax break if they pay no taxes. Not only that, but many of the destinations loved by their passengers are not missing the cruise liners very much, if at all. As Prof Sheela Agarwal, from Plymouth University's department of tourism and hospitality, puts it: No one is willing to bail them out because of their tax avoidance, but also because of the negative impacts they have at their destinations... they contribute very little to the local economy. Cruise ships are notorious for depositing thousands of tourists in crowded cities who, Prof Agarwal says spend very little, look around the place for five or six hours with a packed lunch, and then go back on board for dinner. So, can the industry recover from this crisis? Well there are some good signs amidst all this gloom. Tourists have very short memories, says Prof Agarwal. This is like when a terror attack affects a destination. Look at the attacks in Paris and Brussels - three months maximum [fall in visitor numbers], and they were back to normal. Also, it is fairly obvious what the industry will do the second that travel restrictions are lifted - they will launch a huge advertising campaign and slash their prices, to get customers back. Although as Prof Muller explains, that won't be painless. You have to have these ships pretty full to make a profit, you can discount a lot, but you have to meet your fixed costs, he says. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: Luckily for the industry, oil prices have also collapsed during this downturn, and as fuel prices are one of cruise firms' biggest fixed costs, Prof Muller is certain of one thing: I can guarantee they are buying fuel futures like crazy. If David Reece and his wife Carolyn are anything to go by, the cruise line industry may well bounce back better than most. He says that the ongoing coronavirus outbreak is not going to put us off at all. He is instead looking forward to rescheduling their trip in the next 12 months. David adds that he might also hunt for any special offers. We might go on a last minute cheapy… being retired we can drop tools and go anytime, he says. UK-based Cunard, part of Carnival, the world's largest cruise line operator, and owner of luxury ships including the Queen Mary 2, is also confident that the industry will recover. We have been sailing for 180 years and we look forward to many more, says Simon Palethorpe, Cunard's president. We will get through these tough times together and look forward to welcoming our guests back on board again soon, when the time is right. David adds that even if some smaller companies do go bust, the ships are unlikely to be wasted as they are worth billions. Someone will buy them up, he says. The industry, it seems, will carry on cruising."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52236388,Coronavirus: What Boris Johnson's Greek hero teaches us about epidemics,"As Boris Johnson recovers from Covid-19, he will undoubtedly be thinking of an earlier epidemic, says Oxford classicist Armand D'Angour - the plague that hit Athens in 430 BC, and killed the prime minister's hero, Pericles. It's an episode, D'Angour argues, that holds many lessons for today. Britain's Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, is well versed in the history and culture of ancient Greece. He knows that Western literature begins with a plague, the epidemic described in the opening book of Homer's Iliad - of which Boris can happily declaim scores of verses from memory. And his political hero has long been the ancient Athenian leader, Pericles, whose bust sits in his office in 10 Downing Street. The prime minister has often quoted admiringly the stirring oration given by Pericles to honour the dead after the first year of a destructive war against Sparta. And he will be well aware that Pericles gave a second famous speech a year later, after a devastating plague, probably a form of typhus, had killed around one third of Athens' citizens. Both orations were reported by the contemporary historian Thucydides, whose searing description of the Great Plague is worth reading for its literary virtuosity alone. Commentators today have drawn parallels between the responses of Athenians - ranging from the heroic to the contemptible - and those of valiant NHS staff and scared panic-buyers today. But surprisingly, none has drawn attention to the lesson Thucydides himself intended. What doesn't change, wrote the historian, is human nature; you can expect people to react in similar ways when they encounter events like those that have occurred in the past. He embarked on his work, he says, because a clear grasp of the events he was living through could guide responses to similar events in future. He modelled his method on that of the most innovative medical practitioner of the day, the physician Hippocrates. Rather than prescribing prayers and religious rituals, spells and incantations, or exotic herbs and quack remedies, Hippocrates and his contemporaries were visiting sick patients, meticulously noting their symptoms, and keeping track of how they responded to prescribed treatments such as sleep, exercise, and the regulation of diet. Boris Johnson was a patient at St Thomas' hospital, and is likely to have been participating in a medical trial that compares treatments for Covid-19 - so it may be that Hippocrates will come to his mind, as well as Pericles and Thucydides. One of the worst aspects of the plague was the despair into which people fell on finding they had the disease. Those who were convinced they had no hope were much quicker to give up and die, observed Thucydides. Another was the rate of infection among those who flocked to care for and doctor to others: they died in droves, and had the highest incidence of mortality… In addition, the plague led to greater crime, since criminals calculated on escaping detection and penalties. What might we learn from these observations? First, that people should avoid becoming infected by close contact, and that medical staff and carers should be protected. Secondly, that the law must continue to function robustly. And thirdly, that it is important for people to preserve a positive state of mind. Measures to achieve these aims have been, if in some cases belatedly, widely pursued in the UK and elsewhere. The Athenians survived the plague of 430 BC with astonishing resilience. Just 15 years later they were able to muster a huge military and naval force to mount an offensive expedition overseas. But when the plague struck, Athens had only recently gone to war, and a large contingent of troops had been sent north to pursue hostilities. Sadly, they took the disease with them, and over 1,000 men died from it. One of the soldiers serving on the campaign was the philosopher, Socrates. Not only did he survive infection, allegedly thanks to his physical toughness and discipline, but on return to his plague-ridden city he was said to have tended unscathed to the sick and dying. Socrates had evidently acquired immunity from his earlier exposure to the disease, just as Thucydides himself, who had survived infection, recognised that this made him immune from reinfection. It was to be thousands of years before medical immunity was properly understood, but the historian implies that historical hindsight can itself be a kind of vaccine. History need not simply recall the horrors of the past. It can guide us towards adopting precautions, remind us that accurate observation is vital to ensure a better response in future, and reassure us that normal life will one day return. Meanwhile, we should also remember that history never repeats itself exactly, even if it can offer valuable lessons for posterity. Pericles had been the leading citizen in Athens for over three decades before his death from the plague at the age of 66. Until that day his luck had held to a remarkable degree. He had been admired and bitterly reviled, had fought military campaigns and faced legal trials, and had survived accusations of corruption and sexual misconduct. In his 50s he entered into a passionate and enduring relationship with the brilliant young Aspasia of Miletus, who bore him a child and helped him compose his magnificent funeral oration to the war dead. Britain's prime minister is 55. He has faced stern challenges, has experienced failure as well and success, and has benefited greatly from luck, no less than political skill. When, as is hoped, he makes a full recovery from Covid-19, perhaps busts of the historian Thucydides, the physician Hippocrates, and the philosopher Socrates, should join that of Pericles on his mantelpiece in No.10 Downing Street. Prof Armand D'Angour, the author of Socrates in Love: The making of a philosopher, wrote the Greek ode that Boris Johnson recited at the opening gala of the London Olympics in 2012 In these dark days of Covid-19 some practices have remained timeless - the use of soap, scrubbing and fresh air. Other advice on infectious diseases given my grandfather Dr John Davy Rolleston in 1940 sounds, well, from a bygone era. Does my grandfather's 1940 infectious disease advice still hold true?"
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52260748,"Loans scheme must work faster, government admits","Business Secretary Alok Sharma has admitted that more money needs to go out faster to businesses applying for emergency loans from the government. He said 4,200 loans, worth a total of £800m, had been given to firms seeking cash to survive the coronavirus crisis. However, that is just 1.4% of the 300,000 enquiries that are thought to have been made through the scheme. Mr Sharma said banks were working at pace to issue the loans, which are backed by the government. They've got people working over the weekend talking to customers, making sure that they can process these loans as quickly as possible, he told BBC One's Andrew Marr show. But the former Bank of England governor, Mervyn King, later expressed worries about how few businesses had got money through the scheme. Speaking to Sophy Ridge on Sky News, Mr King said the survival of businesses through the crisis was key to a quick economic recovery. The economy will recover quickly only if we can keep the businesses that existed at the beginning of it still functioning and still able to pick up the reins when the epidemic is over, he said. If we find so few business loans being granted, something has gone wrong. Mr King said it was a mistake to close local bank branches that could have been able to function - with social distancing - to respond to the queries and claims of business trying to apply for coronavirus business interruption loans. Earlier this month, the government overhauled the scheme in response to claims that banks were taking advantage of the crisis. Following criticism from firms and MPs, the government banned banks from asking company owners to guarantee loans with their own savings or property when borrowing up to £250,000. It also removed a requirement that businesses must have been refused a loan on commercial terms in order to be eligible for the scheme after firms complained of facing interest rates of up to 30% and being asked to make unreasonable personal guarantees. Mr Sharma told the BBC that the changes to the scheme would make it more attractive. But he said there would no doubt be economic repercussions following the lockdown measures. I think it is absolutely vital we put the support in now so that, when we come out the other side, business are able to start very quickly."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52064637,Who is Dominic Raab?,"Downing Street says Boris Johnson has asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to deputise for the PM where necessary, while Mr Johnson is in intensive care with coronavirus. So who is he? Less than three years ago, Dominic Raab wasn't even in the government. But now, as foreign secretary and first secretary of state, he is the de-facto second-in-command to Mr Johnson. That means he could take over running the government for a while if the prime minister sees his health worsen. It's an opportunity Mr Raab, a 46-year-old former lawyer, would relish, under normal circumstances. The staunch Brexiteer ran for the Conservative Party leadership last year but he was knocked out in the second round of voting by MPs. Prior to that he had run-ins with Mr Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May, quitting her cabinet after just over four months as Brexit secretary. The sometimes outspoken Mr Raab has had a volatile time - going in and out of favour - since becoming Conservative MP for Esher and Walton, Surrey, in 2010. Date of birth: 25 February 1974 (age 46) Job: Foreign secretary, Conservative MP for Esher and Walton Education: Dr Challoner's Grammar School, Amersham, Oxford and Cambridge universities Family: Married to Erika Ray, a Brazilian marketing executive. Two sons Before politics: Foreign Office lawyer. He was the lead on a team focusing on bringing war criminals to justice at The Hague A married father of two, Mr Raab was born in 1974, the son of a Czech-born Jewish refugee who fled the Nazis in 1938. He was was brought up in Buckinghamshire and attended Dr Challoner's Grammar School in Amersham, before studying law at Oxford University and switching to Cambridge for his master's. He worked as a lawyer in the commercial sector and the Foreign Office before entering politics in 2006 as an aide to Brexit-supporting Conservative MP David Davis, and then Remain-backing Dominic Grieve. First elected to Parliament in 2010, the following year Mr Raab angered then-Home Secretary Theresa May by describing some feminists as obnoxious bigots in an online article also claiming men were getting a raw deal. Mrs May accused him of fuelling gender warfare. Mr Raab remained on the back benches for five years after becoming an MP. But the karate black-belt became a junior justice minister following David Cameron's general election victory in 2015. He played a prominent role in the successful Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum, but was sacked by Mrs May when she took over as prime minister. In 2017, Mr Raab was branded offensive by then-Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron after saying the typical user of a food bank is not someone that's languishing in poverty; it's someone who has a cash flow problem. But in June that year he returned to government, as a justice minister, this time middle-ranking rather than junior. In Mrs May's January 2018 reshuffle he became housing minister - one of the highest-profile non-cabinet roles in government. And in July that year, when Mr Davis quit, the prime minister promoted Mr Raab to Brexit secretary, a cabinet post. Yet his improved relationship with Mrs May did not last long. In November 2018, he quit, criticising her position on Brexit. He argued that he could not in good conscience support the backstop arrangement designed to avoid a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland. As an influential Brexiteer, his comments were seen as significant in increasing opposition to Mrs May's withdrawal agreement with the EU, which MPs repeatedly rejected. After Mrs May announced she was standing down last year, Mr Raab entered the contest to become Conservative leader, and prime minister. In a crowded field, he failed to get the 33 MPs' votes he needed to progress to the third round. Fellow Brexiteers Boris Johnson and Michael Gove outlasted him. Mark Francois, one of the most strongly pro-Brexit of Tory MPs, said: Whoever wins, and I hope it's Boris, I hope they find a good place for Dom in their cabinet, because I think he deserves it. Mr Johnson, to whom Mr Raab gave his support after his elimination from the the race, did just that. On 24 July last year he became foreign secretary and first secretary of state - effectively deputy prime minister. The new job gave him an international profile surpassed only by Mr Johnson's, in terms of the UK government. But he only narrowly managed to hold on to Esher and Walton at last December's general election, seeing off a strong Liberal Democrat challenged by 2,743 votes. The overall Conservative landslide, however, on a promise to get Brexit done, meant he saw his dream of leaving the EU come true on 31 January this year. Since then coronavirus has taken over from Brexit as the UK government's number one priority, although tough negotiations on a trade deal with Brussels are continuing, via video link. Now Mr Raab, as well as being first secretary of state, has effectively taken over running the country as Mr Johnson is being treated in hospital for coronavirus."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52255092,Coronavirus: Domestic abuse services to get £2m amid lockdown,"Domestic abuse services are set to receive an extra £2m as the Home Office launches a new support campaign during the coronavirus lockdown. The additional money will immediately bolster helplines and online support, the home secretary announced. The National Domestic Abuse helpline has seen a 25% increase in calls and online requests since the lockdown. Priti Patel also launched an initiative called 'You Are Not Alone' to help those experiencing domestic abuse. It comes after Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a £750m package for charities during the pandemic. The government said the extra funds will allow those most vulnerable to abuse to access support during periods when it might be difficult to communicate on the phone. People are also being encouraged to take part in the government's campaign by sharing a photo of a heart on their palm in their windows and on social media using #YouAreNotAlone. Martin Hewitt, National Police Chiefs' Council chairman, said 400 domestic abuse suspects were arrested in two weeks in the West Midlands. From next week, social media adverts will highlight where people can find help. Ms Patel said: Coronavirus has opened Britain's enormous heart and shown our love and compassion for one another as we come together to help those who are most in need. I am now asking this nation to use that amazing compassion and community spirit to embrace those who are trapped in the horrific cycle of abuse. To help us all look out for those who need help, we have created a new campaign and we have created a symbol of hope - a handprint embossed with a heart - so that people can easily show that we will not tolerate abuse as a society. Mr Hewitt added: To abusers, do not think that this is a time where you can get away with this. We will still arrest, we will still bring people into custody and we will still prosecute. Ms Patel added that while perpetrators should be the ones to leave homes, the government will work to ensure there is refuge for victims and their children if this is not possible. Ms Patel said anyone in immediate danger should call 999 and press 55 on a mobile if they are unable to talk. Our outstanding police will still be there for you, she added. The campaign will also publicise the support available on the 24-hour freephone National Domestic Abuse Helpline number - 0808 2000 247. Sandra Horley, chief executive of national domestic abuse charity Refuge, welcomed the government's announcement at this critical time. We have worked around the clock to ensure our national helpline and frontline specialist services remain open and accessible to women experiencing domestic abuse, Ms Horley said. What is needed now, more than ever, is to ensure every woman experiencing domestic abuse is aware of the confidential support available. Ms Horley added that she hopes the campaign will reach the tens of thousands of people experiencing domestic abuse. The National Domestic Abuse helpline has seen a spike in calls, with campaigners warning the restrictions in movements as the UK tries to stem the spread of coronavirus could have heightened domestic tensions and limited escape routes. Pressure on other services could also have contributed to the increase, campaigners said."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52260757,Coronavirus: UK Parliament still set to return on 21 April,"Parliament is still on course to return on 21 April to debate coronavirus measures and authorise spending on the UK's pandemic response. It will not be business as usual for MPs, with social distancing measures still likely to be in place. The government needs to pass its Finance Bill, enacting measures in the Budget, which is due to get its second reading on 22 April. Efforts are under way to allow MPs to work remotely. The hospital death toll has climbed to 10,612 since Parliament shut down for an extended Easter recess on 25 March. Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said that when MPs return, Parliament will fulfil its essential constitutional functions of conducting scrutiny, authorising spending and making laws. At the moment, MPs are due to debate a key piece of Brexit legislation, repealing EU free movement in UK law, on 21 April. This will be followed by a normal programme of debates and votes on government legislation. It is not known at this stage whether non-essential business will be put on hold - or to what extent MPs will have to change their normal working practices. At the moment, 40 MPs must be present in the Commons chamber for a vote to take place, but this could be reduced so that party whips could effectively act as proxies for all their MPs, meaning fewer would have to attend votes, according to the Institute for Government. Such a move would need a change to the standing orders, with the government bringing forward a motion which MPs would then agree to. Other changes to the way MPs work - and postponing non-essential business - could be agreed informally between Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle and party leaders. Sir Lindsay is keen to establish a virtual Parliament after successful experiments with video conferencing at select committees. Jacob Rees-Mogg has said plans for remote-working are being made. In these unprecedented times, technological solutions have already been implemented for select committee and options are being prepared for the Speaker, the government and other parties to consider next week, said a spokeswoman for Mr Rees-Mogg. It is important that we have a comprehensive solution that does not inadvertently exclude any members. It comes after Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said MPs must be able to hold the government's decisions to account. Sir Keir said many areas had seen a gap between the announcement of policies and their implementation. Mr Rees-Mogg will respond to a letter from Sir Keir in which he said Parliament must return so that it could subject government decisions and ministers to proper scrutiny. Sir Keir said Labour would support the government where it is right to do so, but would also ask difficult and searching questions... where that is necessary. The principles of the government's lockdown exit strategy, the availability of coronavirus testing and personal protective equipment (PPE), and support for social care services, employees and businesses are among the issues he said must be discussed. We support the announcements of the government on many of these issues, but it is clear from MPs in many constituencies that there is a gap between the announcements and implementation, he said. Speaking on BBC One's Andrew Marr programme, shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said there were shortfalls in the government's support provisions, including for small businesses, and that Parliament's return would ensure that gaps and problems were resolved. We plan to be constructive, we want to help the government get this right, she said. MPs are still able to respond to and help their constituents while the House of Commons is on recess."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52268341,Coronavirus: New Zealand nurse who treated Boris Johnson says it was 'surreal',"A New Zealand nurse praised by Boris Johnson for helping to save his life said treating the prime minister was the most surreal time in her life, her parents have said. Jenny McGee, along with Luis Pitarma from Portugal, was praised by the PM for standing at his bedside when things could have gone either way. Ms McGee's parents told Television New Zealand they are exceptionally proud. They said she treated Mr Johnson like any other patient. Mr Johnson was discharged from St Thomas' Hospital in London on Sunday, one week after being admitted to be treated for coronavirus. He spent several nights in the intensive care unit where he was given oxygen. He said the NHS has saved my life, no question and paid tribute to many medics, singling out Ms McGee and Mr Pitarma specifically. Ms McGee's parents said they knew Mr Johnson was in the hospital their daughter works in as it was all over the news. But our daughter's very professional so we don't ask things or she doesn't spill things. It really wasn't until he was out of intensive care until she actually told us, her mother Caroline told TVNZ. She said she had just had a most surreal time in her life, something she will never forget. And that she had been taking care of Boris. She added: It makes us feel exceptionally proud, obviously. But she has told us these things over the years and it doesn't matter what patient she's looking after, this is what she does and I just find it incredible that she, any nurses, can do this for 12 hours. Sit and watch a patient, and twiddle away with all the different knobs to keep their patients alive. It's absolutely amazing. Her brother Rob said that when he spoke to her she was on her way to work to do another night shift. He told the New Zealand Herald: We are all very proud of Jen, not just in the support she gave Boris - but what she has been doing helping everyday people. Whilst she is blown away by Boris's recognition, she is just really pleased to see the public recognition for the amazing work the NHS is doing - that made her really proud. Ms McGee is from Invercargill, on New Zealand's South Island. The mayor of the city Sir Tim Shadbolt told Stuff.co.nz: It's not very often a nurse from Invercargill saves the life of the British prime minister. Meanwhile, her former school Verdon College paid tribute to her courage, adding she had wanted to be a nurse since leaving school in 2002. Jenny is described by her past teachers as an absolutely delightful person and someone who had a caring and humble nature, the college said in a statement. The second nurse mentioned by Mr Johnson has been named as Luis Pitarma. According to the Expresso, Mr Pitarma, 29, is from Aveiro in Portugal and moved to London six years ago. He studied nursing in Lisbon. It added that he first worked at the Luton and Dunstable University Hospital for two years before moving to St Thomas'. The president of Portugal, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, has personally thanked Mr Pitarma, as well as the commitment of all Portuguese health professionals who in Portugal and around the world are providing decisive help in the fight to the pandemic. On Monday, No 10 confirmed Mr Johnson had left hospital after being given the all clear by medics. He will continue recovering at Chequers, the prime minister's official country residence, as it was considered to be a suitable place and he will not be carrying out government work, the spokesman said. Aides are reportedly expecting Mr Johnson to be out of action for up to a month while he recovers. Mr Johnson spoke to Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab - who is currently in charge of running the government - over the weekend, No 10 added. Speaking in a video posted after he left hospital, Mr Johnson, 55, said it was hard to find words to express my debt to the health service. He thanked many nurses by name before adding: I hope they won't mind if I mention in particular two nurses who stood by my bedside for 48 hours when things could have gone either way. They're Jenny from New Zealand. And Luis from Portugal near Porto. The reason in the end my body did start to get enough oxygen was because for every second of the night they were watching and they were thinking and they were caring and making the interventions I needed. Around one in eight NHS workers - 13.1% of the workforce, or 153,000 staff - are not British, according to a parliamentary report published in July last year. After British, the most common nationalities of NHS staff are Indian with around 21,000 workers, followed by Filipino, Irish, Polish and then Portuguese staff. On Sunday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock paid tribute to everyone who has joined the NHS from all over the world."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52261859,Coronavirus: UK could be 'worst affected' country in Europe,"The UK is likely to be among the European countries worst affected by coronavirus, one of the government's senior scientific advisers has said. The warning from Sir Jeremy Farrar comes as UK hospital deaths are set to pass 10,000 on Sunday. In response, Business Secretary Alok Sharma said countries were on different trajectories. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been discharged from hospital after being treated for coronavirus. On the advice of his medical team, Mr Johnson will not immediately return to work and will continue his recovery at his country residence, Chequers, a No 10 spokesman said. He had three nights in intensive care before returning to a general ward on Thursday. The total number of coronavirus hospital deaths in the UK currently stands at 9,875, following a rise of 917 recorded on Saturday. The figure does not include deaths outside of hospitals, such as in care homes or in the community. On Sunday, a further 657 deaths were announced in England, 24 in Scotland, 18 in Wales and 11 in Northern Ireland. The latest UK-wide figures have not yet been confirmed by the Department of Health. Ministers are continuing to urge people to stay at home over the Easter weekend to curb the spread of the virus, despite warm and sunny weather across parts of the UK. Wellcome Trust director Sir Jeremy Farrar told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show the UK was likely to be one of the worst, if not the worst affected country in Europe. Currently Italy has the highest number of deaths of any European country - with more than 19,000 deaths - followed by Spain, France and the UK, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Germany has kept deaths below 3,000 so far. Sir Jeremy, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show the remarkable scale of testing in Germany had been key to keeping the number of hospital admissions for coronavirus lower than in the UK. Sir Jeremy said testing allowed countries to isolate people with Covid-19, preventing them from transmitting the virus to others, as well as buying time for hospitals to prepare. Undoubtedly there are lessons to learn from that, he added. The UK government has said it wants to do 100,000 coronavirus tests a day by the end of April but has faced criticism for not increasing the number more quickly. Sir Jeremy said a second or third wave of the virus was probably inevitable and treatment and a vaccine was our only true exit strategy. He said a vaccine could be available by autumn but it would take longer to ramp up manufacturing to the scale required to vaccinate many millions of people. I would hope we would get [that] done in 12 months but that is in itself an unprecedented ambition, he said. Asked whether he agreed with Sir Jeremy's analysis of the UK's death rate, Business Secretary Alok Sharma said: Different countries are at different stages of this cycle. What we have done with the advice that we have now set out to people, to stay at home, is precisely because we want to make sure that we have a flattening of the curve, that infection rates aren't going up, and ultimately people's lives are being saved, he told the programme. We are starting to see these measures work, he added, but said it was too early for them to be lifted yet. Prof Keith Neal, emeritus professor in the epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, said it was likely the UK would have one of the largest numbers of coronavirus deaths because it had the second largest population in western Europe after Germany. The important figure is the death rate per million and not the total number of deaths. On this count Belgium seems to be heading for a serious problem like Italy and Spain, he said. There have been so many grim milestones in this coronavirus outbreak but passing a death toll of 10,000 may prove one of the most shocking. There are positive signs that the rate of infection is slowing, driven down by social distancing. But the numbers dying every day may increase still further because some people who caught the virus three or four weeks ago may not survive intensive care now. The scientists advising the government have long warned of this lag between measures to keep the public at home and a reduction in the daily death toll. The expectation is that on current trends there will be a peak, perhaps in a week or two, though no-one can predict how long it'll take after that for the losses to fall to low levels. It all depends on the public's response and so far officials say it's been overwhelmingly supportive. On Saturday evening Mr Johnson paid tribute to the medics treating him, saying: I can't thank them enough. I owe them my life. A message posted from the prime minister's Twitter account also wished the country a happy Easter, as worshippers marked the festival from home. This year across the country churches will remain closed and families will spend the day apart, the message said. But by staying home, remember, you are protecting the NHS and saving lives. Abdul Mabud Chowdhury, 53, was a married father-of-two and a consultant urologist. He died with coronavirus on Wednesday. In other developments:"
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52193461,Coronavirus: Who’s in charge if the PM is ill?,"Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says he has all the authority he needs to make relevant decisions as he deputises for Boris Johnson, who remains in hospital with coronavirus. But who else is sharing power and how are decisions made while the prime minister is ill? Mr Raab is the foreign secretary, but he also has the title of first secretary of state - giving him seniority above all other cabinet ministers. So if the official position changes, and Mr Johnson does not return to his post, Mr Raab would take over in the first instance. When Mr Johnson was moved into intensive care - where his health is said to be improving - Mr Raab said the government would continue to focus at the prime minister's direction on defeating coronavirus. The role of deputy prime minister - like that of first secretary of state - is not a permanent position in government. Someone is appointed at the discretion of the prime minister. The last deputy PM was Liberal Democrat Nick Clegg, during the 2010-15 coalition government with the Conservatives. Although Mr Raab has been asked to deputise for the PM while he is in intensive care, we know very little about exact extent of his authority. There are various things only the prime minister can do - but some of these could be taken up by Mr Raab without much trouble. For example, he could make recommendations to the Queen on appointments to the senior judiciary and high-ranking positions in the Church of England. But it's harder to imagine him conducting a reshuffle - even though, formally, it seems he ought to have that power. It would be tricky for him to authorise military action at short notice. Other ministers would most likely have to agree first, but the buck would stop with Mr Raab. Then, there are the letters of last resort the prime minister writes for nuclear submarines, giving commanding officers instructions about what to do in the event of a deadly attack. It's unlikely Mr Raab would have to write them unless Mr Johnson was incapacitated for a long time. When asked if his role let him take decisions, Mr Raab said there was total unity among his cabinet colleagues and referred to the system of collective responsibility. It means that in practice, any major decisions will probably be taken by Mr Raab in consultation with the cabinet or, where appropriate, senior civil servants. The cabinet is the ultimate decision-making body of government, made up of the most senior ministers including the home secretary, the health secretary and the chancellor of the exchequer. After February's general election, Boris Johnson formed a cabinet of 22 full members - including himself - and four other attending members. So although he's the head of the government and has some individual powers, most important decisions are taken collectively in cabinet. And the principle of collective responsibility means each cabinet decision is binding for each member - even if they personally disagreed with it. Not all decisions are taken by full cabinet. It's normal for there to be cabinet committees - smaller groups of ministers focused on specific issues. There are four implementation committees working on different parts of the response. They're looking at healthcare, the public sector response, economics and business, and the international response. Each is chaired by a cabinet minister and feeding into a daily overarching C-19 meeting - led in the prime minister's absence by Dominic Raab. If Boris Johnson became incapacitated and couldn't continue as PM, the rules for what should happen next are unclear - a consequence of the UK's unwritten constitution. But we do have some idea of what might happen. The cabinet manual is the closest thing we have to a document which sets out the role of the prime minister. It suggests the cabinet would select a replacement who the Queen would ask to form a government. That could be Mr Raab or another senior MP. The expectation is that he or she would be in place until the Conservative Party appointed a new leader. According to the Institute for Government think tank, prime ministers continue in office unless they resign or die. It adds: While political parties usually have the ability to appoint an 'acting leader' if the leader resigns or is incapacitated, there is no formal 'acting prime minister' role. He or she would be prime minister until they chose to resign or if their cabinet forced them out."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52264145,"Coronavirus: 'Sombre day' as UK deaths hit 10,000","The UK has recorded 737 new coronavirus-related hospital deaths, taking the total number to 10,612. It comes after one of the government's senior scientific advisers said the UK was likely to be among the worst-affected European countries. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said today marks a sombre day, but welcomed the efforts people had made to stay at home. The number of reported deaths does not include deaths outside of hospitals. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson thanked healthcare workers for saving his life after being discharged from hospital. Mr Hancock told the daily press briefing: Today marks a sombre day in the impact of this disease as we join the list of countries who have seen more than 10,000 deaths related to coronavirus. The fact that over 10,000 people have now lost their lives to this invisible killer demonstrates just how serious this coronavirus is and why the national effort that everyone is engaged in is so important. The UK is the fifth country to surpass 10,000 deaths, joining the US, Spain, Italy and France. Earlier, Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the UK was likely to be one of the worst, if not the worst affected country in Europe. In comparison, he said, the remarkable scale of testing in Germany had been key to keeping the number of hospital admissions for coronavirus lower than in the UK. Undoubtedly there are lessons to learn from that, he said. Responding to Sir Jeremy's comments, the health secretary said: The future of this virus is unknowable as yet because it depends on the behaviour of millions of people and the great British public. Mr Hancock added that the government took advice from experts very seriously. Public Health England medical director Professor Yvonne Doyle said the number of people in hospital with coronavirus in London was stabilising, but it was increasing in north-west England, Yorkshire and north-east England. Speaking about the loved ones of those who had died, Mr Hancock said: Their grief is our grief and their stories will not be forgotten. Janice Graham, 58, was the first NHS worker in Scotland to die from coronavirus. Her son said he would miss everything about her. The health secretary also congratulated the British public for rising to this challenge of staying at home. Your steadfast commitment to following these social distancing rules is making a difference, he added. Ministers are continuing to urge people to stay at home over the Easter weekend to curb the spread of the virus, despite warm and sunny weather across parts of the UK. Today's fall in the number of newly announced deaths of people with coronavirus is of little comfort as we pass the tragic milestone of 10,000. And we know that the true death toll to date is higher: this figure doesn't include people who have died with coronavirus but whose death has not yet been reported to the Department for Health. But it could have been worse. Up until last weekend, this figure was doubling every three and a half days. Had that continued, we might have seen more than 2,500 deaths announced today. That growth has not happened. Today's fall could be attributed to less reporting of deaths over a bank holiday. Even if we have not turned the corner, the number of deaths announced each day has held below 1,000 throughout the week. That is still a terrifying figure. But the slowdown in the growth of new cases, of people hospitalised with coronavirus and in deaths all add to the evidence that the lockdown is working. The health secretary also announced plans for an NHS app that will warn users if they have recently been in close proximity to someone suspected of having been infected by the coronavirus. Mr Hancock also addressed ongoing criticism over the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) for NHS staff. He denied that the government had been too slow to stockpile PPE and said supplies had been significant, but acknowledged there was always more to be done. There were now record amounts in the system, he added. Mr Hancock said there was more spare capacity for critical care than there was when coronavirus first hit our shores. As of Sunday, there were 2,295 spare critical care beds across Great Britain, up by 150 from Saturday, he said. In other developments:"
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52252470,Coronavirus: Priti Patel 'sorry if people feel there have been failings' on PPE,"The home secretary has said she is sorry if NHS staff feel there has been a failure to provide protective kit for those treating coronavirus patients. But Priti Patel said there were going to be problems during what she called an unprecedented global pandemic. The British Medical Association earlier said that NHS staff were putting their lives at risk when treating patients. The health secretary said earlier that 19 NHS workers had died with coronavirus since the outbreak began. Speaking at Saturday's coronavirus briefing in Downing Street, the home secretary said: I'm sorry if people feel that there have been failings. I will be very, very clear about that. But at the same time, we are in an unprecedented global health pandemic right now. It is inevitable that the demand and the pressures on PPE and demand for PPE are going to be exponential. On Friday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there was enough kit for everyone and unveiled a plan to address shortages. He said the government was looking into how NHS staff who had died with the virus had been infected - adding that some may have caught it outside of work. But that doesn't take away from the bravery of every single NHS worker, he said, adding that his heart goes out to those who have died and their families. Mr Hancock said he was particularly struck at the high proportion of people from minority ethnic backgrounds and people who have come to this country to work in the NHS who have died of coranavirus. We should recognise their enormous contribution, he added. Supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) in London and Yorkshire are at dangerously low levels, according to the BMA. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, BMA council chair, said doctors were being forced into a corner and faced heart-breaking decisions over whether to carry on without proper protection. He said: This is an immensely difficult position to be in, but is ultimately down to the government's chronic failure to supply us with the proper equipment. A nurse at Watford General Hospital in Hertfordshire, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the BBC he felt unsafe with the level of PPE he had been given. He said shortages meant those working on wards with coronavirus patients were only being given a surgical mask and plastic apron, rather than a gown covering the whole body. Last week a nursing assistant who had been looking after coronavirus patients at the hospital died. We are scared because we are spreading the virus, he said. We don't deserve it and our patients even more. The health secretary said 742 million pieces of protective gear had been delivered so far, saying: There's enough PPE to go around, but only if it's used in line with our guidance. We need everyone to treat PPE like the precious resource that it is. Mr Hancock said he was not impugning anyone who works for the NHS and they do an amazing job. But what I am reiterating, stressing, is the importance to use the right amount of PPE, he added. However, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was insulting to imply frontline staff are wasting PPE and the government must act to ensure sufficient supplies are delivered. For several weeks, the government and NHS leaders have insisted there are enough stocks of personal protective equipment (PPE) and that the problem lay in the distribution from warehouses to the front line. Some hospitals have reported receiving higher consignments of gloves, masks, gowns and aprons. But doctors and nurses have continued to report shortages. Care homes, pharmacies, GP practices and community health teams feel they are at the back of the queue for equipment to protect staff who may come into contact with patients who have Covid-19. There has also been confusion over how safety guidelines should apply. Now Matt Hancock has admitted there are global supply problems and says it is a herculean effort to get deliveries to health workers and a huge task to keep it going. He set out a series of measures to step up provision of equipment. He may be given credit for acknowledging the scale of the problem. But NHS and care staff won't take much notice of plans until they are reflected in reality on the ground. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has dismissed any suggestion that healthcare staff have been overusing PPE. RCN chief executive Dame Donna Kinnair told the BBC no PPE was more precious a resource than a healthcare worker's life, a nurse's life, a doctor's life. I take offence, actually, that we are saying that healthcare workers are abusing or overusing PPE, she told BBC Breakfast, adding that nurses were still telling her they did not have adequate supply of protective equipment. Meanwhile, the business organisation Make It British said the government had not yet taken up offers from some firms to help manufacture PPE. The group said at least 100 companies had responded to an appeal for help four weeks ago but had heard nothing since. How have you been affected by the issues relating to coronavirus?

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52229828,Coronavirus: Six ways the lockdown has changed the UK,"Life in the UK has been utterly transformed in the three weeks since restrictions were brought in to curb the spread of coronavirus. On Monday 23 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said all non-essential travel and public gatherings had to stop, with people urged to leave home only for exercise, to shop for essential items, for medical care, or when their work could not be done at home. All shops selling non-essential items closed. Pubs, restaurants, theatres, cinemas and places of worship have all also shut. These restrictions have affected all aspects of society. The lockdown's aim has been to limit the spread of coronavirus across the country, to help the NHS to cope and ultimately reduce the number of deaths from the disease. Since the lockdown started on 23 March, the number of people who have tested positive for coronavirus has gone from 6,650 to more than 80,000. But the government's advisers have said there is evidence that the public's adherence to the measures is starting to have an impact. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, said: It's not taking off in that sharp uptake, it's not gone sky high. And if anything there might even be some flattening. That is because of what we're all doing with social distancing. People are also adapting to how they use the health service. In March, the number of people attending A&E dropped whilst the numbers of calls made to 111 - the NHS's hotline - reached record highs. The public's use of transport has fallen dramatically over the past few weeks, although this trend started before the lockdown measures were announced by the prime minister, as many people started to work from home. Overall transport use - across road, rail and the Tube in London - fell by 60% between early February and the beginning of April, the Department for Transport says. Footfall at major railway stations across the country has also fallen significantly since the lockdown was introduced, data from Network Rail suggests. For example, in the week before the measures were brought in, footfall at Birmingham New Street station stood at over half a million. But that had fallen by 86% at the start of April to just 71,230. It's a similar trend for London and Manchester. Meanwhile, trips to parks and beaches on 5 April, the second Sunday of lockdown, were 29% lower than normal according to Google analytics data. But the previous Sunday they were 52% lower than normal, suggesting trips were creeping back up with the warmer weather. Air pollution levels in the UK have dropped significantly in the weeks since the country went into lockdown. The nitrogen dioxide (NO2) level has fallen across the UK, with the daily average down almost 40% on the same period last year. NO2, released from car exhausts, is a serious air pollutant. Some cities have seen levels fall by more than 60%, including Brighton and Portsmouth, according to BBC analysis of Defra statistics. Daily readings from air quality monitoring stations were compared with the same period last year. About 723,000 people have applied for universal credit since the lockdown began. Of these, 473,000 applied in the first eight days, almost as many as applied during the whole of the preceding three weeks, and almost 10 times as many as would apply in an average week. A further 250,000 people signed up during the second week of lockdown according to the Department for Work and Pensions. Universal credit is a consolidated monthly payment for those of working-age, which replaced a host of previous benefits including income-based jobseeker's allowance, housing benefit, child tax credit and working tax credit. While furlough payments are available to help the self-employed and those who cannot do their jobs during the pandemic, some groups - such as those who have recently became a freelancer, moved jobs or been made redundant before the cut-off date are not eligible. This has helped prompt an increase in universal credit claims. While there is still considerable pressure on the benefits system, the figures show that the number of claims is now starting to come down, having peaked in the first week of lockdown. In the week before the restrictions started, supermarket sales were 44% higher than the same time last year, as many rushed to stock up amid fear of shortages. But average sales fell by 7.5% over the first fortnight of lockdown according to consultancy Neilsen. When the country was told not to travel people stopped shopping, says Mike Watkins, Nielsen's head of retailer and business insight. They had already bought a lot of stuff, and their larders and freezers were full. While more people tried to shop online, as 93% of purchases are normally made in-store, supermarkets have struggled to cope with the extra demand, he adds. Supermarket sales of non-food products such as clothes slumped 45%, and impulse buys have dipped. The enthusiasm of shoppers to buy nice food will be muted, as people want to limit travel and time spent in stores, Mr Watkins says. The National Domestic Abuse helpline has seen a 25% increase in calls since the lockdown, the charity Refuge says. It is now receiving hundreds of extra calls for help every week. Isolation can make pre-existing abusive behaviour worse, but isn't the reason for it, says Refuge, which runs the helpline. The increase echoes findings from around the world, including a 32% surge in reported domestic violence cases in France, and a 12% increase to Spain's gender violence hotline since lockdowns began in those countries. However, overall crime reported to police in England and Wales has dropped by around 20% in recent weeks. New police powers for fining those who breach the lockdown rules are being used - in the first two weeks, 1,084 fines were issued.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52266314,Coronavirus: UK enters fourth week of lockdown ahead of review,"The UK is facing its fourth week in lockdown, with the government set to review by Thursday whether social distancing measures can be changed. Ministers are required by law to assess whether the rules are working, based on expert advice, after three weeks of telling Britons to stay at home. It comes as an NHS boss has warned staff are facing a hand-to-mouth supply of protective gowns. Meanwhile, the PM has thanked NHS staff after being discharged from hospital. The mother of a nurse who Boris Johnson specifically praised said she was exceptionally proud of her daughter. Wales' health minister said last week that the coronavirus lockdown would remain for several more weeks at the very least. And Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned there was no likelihood or prospect of measures being lifted after the Easter weekend. On Sunday, the UK's total number of hospital deaths linked to coronavirus reached 10,612. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers in England which represents hospital trusts, told BBC Breakfast that the number of protective gowns - imported from China - available to NHS staff in some parts of the country has fallen critically low in recent days. Mr Hopson said that the NHS ordered a whole load of stock weeks ago, but delays have been caused by the gowns sometimes failing safety tests, while other batches have been mislabelled - meaning the NHS has ended up with additional masks. He added: If everything had been flowing exactly as had been ordered and if all of the material had properly passed its safety test, there would not be an issue. This is all really hand-to-mouth in terms of gown delivery, and we need to get to a more sustainable supply. Mr Johnson had spent a week at St Thomas' Hospital in London - including three nights in intensive care - where he was being treated for Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. It is unclear whether the prime minister - who is now recuperating at Chequers, his country home in Buckinghamshire - will take part in the lockdown review. In a video message to the nation recorded after he left hospital, 55-year-old Mr Johnson said it could have gone either way as he thanked NHS staff for saving his life. He singled out two nurses - Jenny McGee from New Zealand and Luis Pitarma from Portugal - for caring for him at his bedside for 48 hours at the most critical time. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is currently in charge of running the government, with aides reportedly expecting Mr Johnson to be out of action for as long as a month. Asked how long it would be before Mr Johnson returned to work, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it would be a clinical decision for his doctors to take with him. Speaking at the Downing Street briefing on Sunday, Mr Hancock insisted the government is operating perfectly efficiently within the strategy that he set out. Labour shadow cabinet minister Rachel Reeves said her party is calling on the government to publish its exit strategy for ending the lockdown. Under the current rules, people are urged to stay at home and to only go out if they have a reasonable excuse, which includes exercise, shopping for basic necessities, healthcare and essential travel to or from work. Ms Reeves suggested ways of easing restrictions could include rolling out mass testing, shielding the most vulnerable while others get back to normal life and lifting the restrictions temporarily but reintroducing them if the virus starts to spread again. Although it's not the moment now to end the lockdown we need to think about where we are going to be in two, three, four weeks' time and now start looking at that plan, she told BBC Breakfast. Speaking ahead of the Easter Bank holiday weekend, Mr Raab said it was still too early to lift lockdown restrictions, insisting they would need to stay in place until evidence showed the UK had moved beyond the peak of the virus. But ministers may also have to consider any economic fallout of the lockdown measures, with a report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) think-tank suggesting 25% of the UK economy could be lost by the summer due to the current controls in place. Business Secretary Alok Sharma, when asked about the NIESR report, told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show there would no doubt be economic repercussions following the lockdown measures. The BBC's political correspondent Ben Wright said it is expected that social distancing measures will be continued, but he added that ministers are having to weigh up their responsibility to fight the disease with protecting the economy. Recently widowed Hannah - not her real name - has told how her husband of more than 40 years died after contracting coronavirus. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that her husband was in hospital for about a week before he died, and was put on a CPAP machine, which delivers oxygen to the lungs without needing a ventilator, to aid his breathing during that time. Describing his death, she said his breathing was really laboured. It is not a nice, quiet way to go, she said. Hannah added: This is such a cruel disease. Apart from the medical staff that he saw when he had to, [my husband] was alone for a week. I was alone at home, and I'm now alone at home. Nobody can give me a hug. My friends have rallied around, my church and everybody have been fabulous, but nobody can give me a hug. And I'm not lonely, I want to make that clear, I'm not lonely but I am alone. On Sunday, 737 new coronavirus-related hospital deaths were recorded, taking the total number to 10,612. Mr Hancock said it marked a sombre day for the nation, as it became the fifth country to surpass 10,000 deaths, joining the US, Spain, Italy and France. Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the UK was likely to be one of the worst, if not the worst affected country in Europe. The latest UK figures only include deaths recorded in hospitals, not those who died in care homes or in the community. Sam Monaghan, the head of the UK's largest charity care provider MHA, told BBC Breakfast that about 150 of its residents had died with confirmed or suspected coronavirus, as well as two staff members. He said the provider - which runs 90 care homes and 43 retirement living sites - was somewhat in the dark about the exact number of deaths, because not everyone who died was tested, although they may have been showing symptoms.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-52270186,Sturgeon: Coronavirus lockdown 'unlikely to be lifted' soon,"Scotland's coronavirus lockdown is not likely to be lifted in the very near future, Nicola Sturgeon has said. The first minister said there were early optimistic signs that social distancing measures were having an impact on the spread of the virus. But she said that until we know more and have solid evidence, we must stick with it. She said the lockdown would not be in place for a single minute longer than necessary, but it remains essential. Interim chief medical officer Dr Gregor Smith also said the lockdown measures were expected to remain in place for a significant period of time. Ms Sturgeon said a total of 6,076 Scots had now tested positive for coronavirus, although she stressed that this would be an under-estimate and did not include figures from some local laboratories. She said there were 1,797 patients in hospital, 211 of whom are in intensive care. And a further nine people have died after testing positive for the virus, bringing the total figure to 575. However, Ms Sturgeon stressed a note of caution around the figures, as they only include hospital deaths where patients have recorded a positive test and there tends to be a reporting lag over the weekends. More detailed figures including deaths in care homes and other settings - and those where coronavirus is a suspected cause - will be released on Wednesday. By law, the UK's lockdown restrictions have to be reviewed every 21 days, and are set to be looked at this week. However, Ms Sturgeon said there was no prospect of them being lifted in the short term. She said: I want to be very clear, so nobody is under any illusions - that review is not likely to result in these restrictions being lifted in the very near future. There are early optimistic signs that the steps we are taking are working, but until we know more and have solid evidence, we must stick with it. Stressing that the stringent measures remain essential, the first minister added: They will not be in force for a single minute longer than necessary, but if we lift them too early or do so without thinking through properly how we can ease them while still keeping the virus under control, then we risk it spreading out of control, risk it overwhelming our NHS and risk it taking many more lives. The traditional Easter message is one of rebirth and renewal. The message from the Scottish government, embroiled as it is in the country's biggest crisis in decades, can't be so uplifting. Don't delay funerals was the grim theme of what the interim chief medical officer had to say. Some families, it seems, may want to delay holding a service until the government lifts strict limits of how many family and friends can attend. It underlines how the virus - and the lockdown - impact on everyone's lives. The first minister made it clear there'll be a review of restrictions this week - but they're not likely to be lifted in the very near future. The key goal, she said, was saving lives. What then of an exit strategy from the lockdown? On this too, there was caution - a need to wait and see how lifting controls might work - or backfire - in other European countries. Nicola Sturgeon said the more consistency across the UK the better, when restrictions are eased. But if Scotland has to take a different approach for practical reasons, she's happy to do so. Ms Sturgeon said we need to understand a bit more than we do now about the impact these measures have had before consideration is given to lifting them. She said that the virus may not have gone away, and that having repressed it there was a danger that it could start to spread again after restrictions are lifted. The first minister said that when measures are eased, the country could effectively go back into a contain strategy where the virus is kept in check via testing, tracing, and isolating. Dr Smith said there was real interest in developing a new app to help trace people who may have the virus, and said it looks very promising as a way of tracking cases - although he said it would be linked to traditional methods of contact tracing. Ms Sturgeon said when this happened in different parts of the UK would depend on the evidence, not a point of constitutional ideology either way. She said simplicity of messaging might make it easier to maintain a consistent approach across the whole UK, but said if the evidence showed different timescales or approaches should be used in Scotland then we will not hesitate to do that."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52262012,Coronavirus: Boris Johnson says 'it could have gone either way',"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said it could have gone either way as he thanked healthcare workers for saving his life after being discharged from hospital. Mr Johnson, 55, was taken to London's St Thomas' Hospital on Sunday - 10 days after testing positive for Covid-19. He spent three nights in intensive care before returning to a ward on Thursday. He said in a video on Twitter that he had witnessed the personal courage of hospital staff on the front line. Mr Johnson said two nurses - Jenny from New Zealand and Luis from Portugal - stood by his bedside for 48 hours at the most critical time and named several other hospital workers who cared for him this past week that he wanted to thank. He said NHS workers kept putting themselves in harm's way, kept risking this deadly virus. It is thanks to that courage, that devotion, that duty and that love that our NHS has been unbeatable, he said. Downing Street said the PM would continue his recovery at his country residence, Chequers. On the advice of his medical team, the PM will not be immediately returning to work. He wishes to thank everybody at St Thomas' for the brilliant care he has received. All of his thoughts are with those affected by this illness. The UK has recorded 737 new coronavirus-related hospital deaths as of 17:00 BST on Saturday, taking the total number to 10,612. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was delighted the PM was out of hospital and continuing his recovery at Chequers. He added that staff at St Thomas' would have cared for him as they would have cared for anybody in this country, which was one of the things that makes me so proud that the NHS is there for us all. Asked how long it would be before the prime minister returned to work, he said: That will be a clinical decision for his doctors to take with him. The government is operating perfectly efficiently within the strategy he set out. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is currently in charge of running the government, with aides reportedly expecting Mr Johnson to be out of action for as long as a month. Dr Ian Abbs, chief executive at Guy's and St Thomas' hospital, said: It is a great credit to the exceptional professionalism of clinical teams, as well as everyone in the wider organisation, that we have been able to care for the prime minister so effectively, whilst continuing to deliver equally high standards of care to all of our patients. While it is right that we celebrate this good news, our thoughts turn immediately to those who still need our help at this time. On behalf of everyone at Guy's and St Thomas', I'd ask that people stay home to help us save lives and protect the NHS. The prime minister's fiancee, Carrie Symonds, who is due to give birth in two months, said on Twitter: Thank you also to everyone who sent such kind messages of support. Today I'm feeling incredibly lucky. There were times last week that were very dark indeed. My heart goes out to all those in similar situations, worried sick about their loved ones. I cannot thank our magnificent NHS enough. The staff at St Thomas' Hospital have been incredible. I will never, ever be able to repay you and I will never stop thanking you. Ms Symonds has been self-isolating with coronavirus-like symptoms but has not been tested. Even before we heard that Boris Johnson had been discharged from hospital it was clear the prime minister would not be rushing back to work. And his fiancée Carrie Symonds' tweet - which refers to dark times last week - is a further sign of how unwell he's been. So, for now, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab will continue to deputise. But the extent to which Boris Johnson may want to feed into any upcoming decisions - while not being fully back at work - isn't yet known. Much may depend on the advice of his doctors. But the fact that the man who was elected to run the country is out of hospital will see many feel relieved. Like or loathe his politics. Agree or disagree with the way the coronavirus outbreak has been handled so far, Boris Johnson is the elected prime minister and political authority ultimately rests with that office. And authority will likely be what's needed when big decisions lie ahead. Chequers has been the official country residence of serving UK prime ministers since 1921. The Grade 1 listed mansion, set in 1,000 acres of Buckinghamshire countryside, is about 40 miles north-west of London."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52183295,Coronavirus lockdown: How can we lift restrictions?,"When can I see my family? Have friends round? Have a night out? A holiday? Or even go back to work? When can children go back to school? Lockdowns have been essential for containing the spread of coronavirus, but they are causing huge disruption, and distress, to lives around the world. So when can they be lifted? There are big decisions for governments to make - when to act, which restrictions to lift, how to contain the virus instead and how to balance saving lives today with long-term damage to society. This is going to be a long journey - don't think it will all be over in a few weeks. Essentially we've got a lot of not very good options, it won't be one day and everything will change, but things could open up, Dr Adam Kucharski, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the BBC. We cannot simply return to normal after cases peak or even after they are reduced to very low levels. The best estimate of the proportion of people infected (and potentially immune) in the UK is just 4%. Or to put that another way - more than 63 million are still vulnerable to the infection. If we just lift the lockdown, then another explosive outbreak is inevitable. The fundamentals of the virus have not changed either - one person infected will, without a lockdown, pass it onto three others on average. Cutting those infections by 60-70% is what it takes to keep cases down. At the moment that means cutting our human contact by that amount. If we lift social distancing measures then something else has to come in to suppress the virus instead or at least to prevent people ending up in intensive care. There may be some easy wins if countries are already cutting infections by more than 70%. There is evidence that a lot of countries in lockdown have gone beyond that, in China it is 80-90%, said Dr Kucharski. A high number now is good for bringing cases down quickly. But it is also an opportunity to lift some of the current restrictions without leading to a spike in cases. China, particularly in the original epicentre of the pandemic - Wuhan, had a tough and lengthy lockdown that including shutting down public transport. It is not yet clear how much wiggle room other countries may or may not have. Massively increasing testing for the virus allows for a strategy called seek and destroy. You identify cases. Test anybody they came into contact with. And isolate them before they become infectious. It is remarkably similar to the approach taken at the start of the outbreak when there were relatively few imported cases being hunted down. Do this successfully enough and it will reduce the ability of the virus to spread and will mean we do not need as tough a set of restrictions on day-to-day life. At the moment you need, on average, a 60-70% reduction in social interactions to stop the outbreak increasing, said Dr Kucharski. If we can get that down to 30% that gives you a lot more to play with. But even massive testing is not life as normal. You would need other measures to keep the disease in check and these would have to be maintained in the long-term as the fundamentals (a virus that spreads and a vulnerable population) would not change. It is a more moderate version of where we are now, said Dr Kucharski. It is also intensive work that has to be done quickly in order to stay ahead of the infection (this is where talk of a smartphone app comes in to identify cases) and the method is most viable when cases are at low levels. Another strategy is called enhanced shielding. Instead of trying to suppress the coronavirus across every section of society you could instead aim to stop it completely for those most at risk. Age and other medical conditions greatly increase the risk of Covid-19 becoming fatal. The lockdown is preventing intensive care units being overwhelmed, but guaranteeing vulnerable groups don't get infected could achieve the same aim even if cases were spreading more widely in the young and the healthy. Prof Mark Woolhouse, from the University of Edinburgh, said: Very crudely, for 80% of us who are not vulnerable this is a nasty virus, it's certainly a significant health problem, but it wouldn't overwhelm the healthcare system and it wouldn't lock down society. If we really bolster that shielding, make a very strong shield indeed, then it buys you a lot more room and it may mean you can relax some measures permanently. We are already shielding the vulnerable and asking them to stay at home for 12 weeks. Enhancing that could mean all staff in hospitals, care homes or anyone visiting the elderly having regular testing to ensure they are clear of the virus. Ideally antibody tests would prove they are immune to it. The danger is having more virus circulating in the community could be harder to control and then those shields will come under intense pressure. Some restrictions have less of an effect on the virus than others. There are certain interactions and activities that are overall less risky, said Dr Kucharski. He argues lifting different restrictions can be put into three broad categories - those with low, moderate and substantial risk of increasing transmission of the virus. Low risk includes exercising outdoors, which has been restricted in some countries. Moderate would include letting some non-essential shops re-open or having occasional gatherings with people outside the household. Substantial increases could come from lifting advice to work from home, reopening schools or isolating sick people and quarantining households. I think the order things went in will be reflected in the order things will be lifted, he says. But which measures to lift will be a difficult balancing act. It will have to be a combination of the benefits to society and the economy against the impact on the spread of the virus. Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, said: We do want to find a collection of policies that maintain suppression of this virus. Without doubt, measures will be targeted probably by age, by geography and we will need to introduce in my view larger levels of testing at the community level to really isolate cases more effectively and identify where transmission is happening. The idea of immunity passports or certificates is constantly doing the rounds - if you've had the disease you have a test and if you have antibodies that can kill the virus then you can go about your daily life. However, there are a number of scientific challenges. We don't have an accurate antibody test. We don't know how long immunity might last. And we don't know that even if antibodies stop you from becoming ill whether they are enough to stop you harbouring the virus and spreading it to others. Prof Ferguson has suggested measures could begin to be lifted by the end of May. But there is also a decision about how far we go with suppressing the virus after we've gone past the peak. We could drive levels down as low as possible and that will greatly limit the ability of the virus to bounce back in a second wave. But the trade off is maintaining the lockdown for longer. Or we could exit lockdown earlier and accept having a higher number of cases bubbling away, which creates its own problems. There is also a decision over whether to maintain a UK-wide approach to lifting lockdown or whether measures could vary regionally, or even within cities, to focus on where outbreaks are happening. The biggest thing that could come along is a vaccine - if people were immunised then there would be no need for any social distancing measures. That is thought to be more than a year away. If a vaccine does not come along (people are hopeful, but it is requiring development at unprecedented speed) then the concept of herd immunity may kick in. This would happen when so many people had been infected (up to 70% of the population) that the virus can no longer cause large outbreaks. Effective drugs would also make a huge difference. If they could stop Covid-19 from progressing from a cough or fever into a serious disease needing intensive care then having large numbers of cases would be less of a problem. Again we are waiting for the results of clinical trials. We might get closer to normality, or at least normality for some, in the months to come. But we are all still in this for the long haul.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52189281,Coronavirus: Huawei urges UK not to make 5G U-turn after pandemic,"Chinese telecoms company Huawei has said that disrupting its involvement in the rollout of 5G would do Britain a disservice. In January, the UK government approved a limited role for Huawei in building the country's new data networks. But in March, a backbench rebellion within the Conservative party signalled efforts to overturn the move. In an open letter, the firm also said it was focused on keeping the UK connected during the Covid-19 crisis. But the pandemic may increase pressure on the government to take a tougher line on the company. In the letter, Huawei's UK chief Victor Zhang says home data use has increased by at least 50% since the virus first hit the UK, placing significant pressure on telecoms systems. Huawei says it has been working with partners like BT, Vodafone and EE to deal with the growth and has also set up three new warehouses around the country to ensure spare parts stay in supply. Mr Zhang also says the current crisis has highlighted how many people, especially in rural communities, are stuck in a digital slow lane. And he warns that excluding Huawei from a future role in 5G would be a mistake. There are those who choose to continue to attack us without presenting any evidence, he writes. Disrupting our involvement in the 5G rollout would do Britain a disservice. The government has banned Huawei from the most sensitive parts of the UK's mobile networks, and limited it to 35% of the periphery, which includes its radio masts. But critics argue it is a security risk to allow the Chinese company to play any role at all because of fears it could be used by Beijing to spy on or even sabotage communications. In early March, 38 Conservatives MPs rebelled on the issue, a larger number than expected. That points to a potential upset when the Telecoms Infrastructure Bill comes before Parliament, which is planned to happen later in the year. The coronavirus crisis highlights the tension between economic and national security issues that makes the topic so contentious. On one side is the need for greater connectivity to boost economic growth. Supporters of Huawei's role argue that excluding it would both slow down and raise the cost of delivering faster and more reliable networks. On the other side is anger directed at China from some quarters because of its perceived mishandling of the initial Covid-19 outbreak, as well as the wider concerns over growing dependence on its technologies and companies. Unnamed ministers and senior officials were recently quoted as saying there would have to be a reckoning once the current crisis is over. Part of that could involve a reversal of January's decision - a concern which may explain the decision to write the letter. On 4 April a group of 15 Conservative MPs called for a rethink on relations with China in their own letter to the Prime Minister, written a day before he was admitted to hospital. Over time, we have allowed ourselves to grow dependent on China and have failed to take a strategic view of Britain's long-term economic, technical and security needs, the group wrote. Among the signatories were Iain Duncan Smith, David Davis and Bob Seely. It is understood that Huawei waited until the Prime Minister was out of hospital before releasing its letter."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52269671,Animal Crossing removed from sale in China amid Hong Kong protests,"The Nintendo Switch's current best-selling game has been removed from Chinese online stores after activists used it to criticise the state. Animal Crossing: New Horizons lets players customise their own island and invite others to visit. Some players in Hong Kong have used the platform to stage protests. Players in mainland China had previously been able to buy foreign editions of the title from online marketplaces. The country's censors strictly regulate video games and had yet to approve the title's formal release in the country. Now, even local sites which had advertised imported copies have removed the listings. It is not clear, however, whether this is because there has been an intervention by the authorities or whether the stores are proactively removing the product. The BBC has asked Nintendo for comment. “Animal Crossing is fast becoming a new way for Hong Kong protesters to fight for democracy!” Joshua Wong, leader of the Hong Kong youth activist group Demosisto, wrote on Twitter last week. This is how #hongkong ppl spend our time during coronavirus lockdown - villain hitting in #animalcrossing, the villain is #CarrieLam, the worst governor in #hongkong history.#AnimalCrossingNewHorizons#StandWithHK pic.twitter.com/K5AbOTl9tD End of Twitter post by @studioincendo #動物森友會 #AnimalCrossing #ACNH #NintendoSwitch pic.twitter.com/vpkft1nIfL End of Twitter post by @boco_chang Examples include banners that read: Free Hong Kong - Revolution Now. There are also disparaging posts featuring images of Chinese President Xi Jinping and Hong Kong’s chief executive Carrie Lam. Before the virus struck, millions of Hong Kong's residents had participated in anti-government street protests. “After the outbreak of coronavirus, it was difficult to organise physical gatherings,” Mr Wong continued. With a new game out, we can have virtual protests and we just have to use our creativity to make a new kind of protest tool. Players in mainland China have also customised the game with coronavirus-related content, including face masks for the characters, and islands with temperature checkpoints, news site Abacus reported. This is not the first time Hong Kong protesters have made use of video games. In December, they began dressing up characters in Grand Theft Auto Online in related clothing. Prior to that, they shared maps advertising Pokemon Go events to signal where rallies would be held. Trade in Animal Crossing on the mainland still continues to a lesser extent, involving private sales arranged via direct messages among other methods, according to Daniel Ahmad, from the consultants firm Niko Partners. In February, another video game - Plague Inc, in which players spread a deadly virus around the world - was removed from Apple’s Chinese App Store after the local regulator judged the content to be illegal during the coronavirus outbreak."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-52230082,Coronavirus: Could gaming be good for you during lockdown?,"For gamers around the country, lockdown might appear to be an ideal opportunity to hone your skills in pretty much every waking moment. But how much should we be playing online? And could it offer some benefits at a time of social isolation? According to Dr Dayna Galloway, who heads of the division of games and arts at Abertay University, the main message - as in all things - is not to overdo it. Screentime guidance varies for age groups - but the key is to ensure a healthy balance across activities, he said. It's important for individuals to ensure a mix of physical activity, sedentary behaviour such as reading and screen time, and, of course, a good night's sleep. Isolation and lockdown in different circumstances will of course skew this, but it's important for people to try to maintain as much balance as possible. There are a range of activities aimed at trying to persuade young people in particular to take a screen break. In Dumfries and Galloway, the council's youth work team has sent out isolation packs which include old-school games like dominoes and playing cards. The Wigtown Book Festival recently launched a writing competition for children from eight to 18. The Scottish Book Trust is also encouraging us to get our pens out and contribute stories to a publication planned on the theme of future. In addition, fitness classes have gone online and are proving particularly successful. A recent festival in Dumfries highlighted the positive aspects of gaming and these could be particularly relevant while confined to your home for large parts of the day. Dr Galloway said online gameplay allowed for communication and collaboration to achieve goals or compete with others. It easily replaces some of the activities that are no longer feasible due to social distancing and isolation, he said. It's very important for mental well-being to maintain relationships and contact with friends and family, and online games are an excellent method for facilitating this. The games themselves also create emergent outcomes and scenarios that create positive shared experiences, and memories for those engaged with them. He said that meant they could have more impact than a video call and were a good replacement in the current circumstances for other forms of social interaction. Entertainment such as games and streaming services also help us pass the time and, more importantly, stay indoors - so this aspect is particularly helpful in the situation we are in, he added. There are different potential benefits attached, according to the type of game being played. Minecraft, Sea of Thieves or Fortnite can help maintain social activity and encourage contact with your peer-group. Dr Galloway said they boosted communication, creativity and collaboration. Other games encourage physical activity, which is something we are being encouraged to maintain. It may be a good opportunity to dust off the Nintendo Wii for some Wii Sports, suggested Dr Galloway. Pokemon Go, with social distancing, could be used on a daily exercise walk. But it might also be time to go retro - but using technology to give it a twist. Raid the cupboard or pick up some traditional board games to have some fun with whoever you are under lockdown with, suggested Dr Galloway. Some games can also be played over video chats - if you are creative and promise not to cheat. But above all, the recommendation is moderation for however long lockdown may continue."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52263244,Coronavirus: UK confirms plan for its own contact tracing app,"The UK has confirmed plans for an app that will warn users if they have recently been in close proximity to someone suspected to be infected with the coronavirus. The health secretary Matt Hancock announced the move at the government's daily pandemic press briefing. He said the NHS was working closely with the world's leading tech companies on the initiative. But one expert who has advised the effort has raised doubts about it. The BBC has learned that NHSX - the health service's digital innovation unit - will test a pre-release version of the software with families at a secure location in the North of England next week. At present, the idea is that people who have self-diagnosed as having coronavirus will be able to declare their status in the app. The software will then send the equivalent of a yellow alert to any other users who they have recently been close to for an extended period of time. If a medical test confirms that the original user is indeed infected, then a stronger warning - effectively a red alert - will be sent instead, signalling that the other users should go into quarantine. To report testing positive, the user would have to enter a verification code, which they would have received alongside their Covid-19 status. Mr Hancock signalled that using the app would be voluntary, in the brief comments he made about it. If you become unwell with the symptoms of coronavirus, you can securely tell this new NHS app, he explained. And the app will then send an alert anonymously to other app users that you've been in significant contact with over the past few days, even before you had symptoms, so that they know and can act accordingly. All data will be handled according to the highest ethical and security standards, and would only be used for NHS care and research. And we won't hold it any longer than is needed. His reference to a tie-up with tech companies was a nod to Apple and Google, which announced on Friday that they were working on a software building block, known as an API, to make it easier for others to build contact tracing apps. NHSX was not aware of this project beforehand, but now plans to integrate the technology into its own product. Its system will keep track of handsets that came close to each other by recording when they detected each others' Bluetooth signals. One benefit of using Apple and Google's API is that the NHS app will not have to employ workarounds to keep monitoring the signals even when the app is not active. Part of the reason Apple and Google say they developed their own idea was to ensure that iOS and Android users' privacy would not be compromised. Their method is designed so that citizens can trigger and receive alerts without the authorities being notified of who was involved. But one cyber-security expert who has been consulted about the app listed a series of worries about the project in a blog. The University of Cambridge's Prof Ross Anderson: I recognise the overwhelming force of the public-health arguments for a centralised system, but I also have 25 years' experience of the NHS being incompetent at developing systems and repeatedly breaking their privacy promises when they do manage to collect some data of value to somebody else, added the professor of security engineering. I'm really uneasy about collecting lots of lightly-anonymised data in a system that becomes integrated into a whole-of-government response to the pandemic. We might never get rid of it. The Behavioural Insights Team - a private company also known as the Nudge Unit - is advising the government on how to encourage as many people to download and use the app as possible. NHSX believes more than half the population going outside needs to be using it for automated contact tracing to be effective."

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-52222547,Final Fantasy 7 Remake: 'This is not just for the players of the original',"Cloud Strife and his iconic mop of spiked blonde hair emerge through the rising steam of an overcrowded city. The main character of Final Fantasy 7 has his distinctive buster sword strapped to his back. This time, however, he's not a pixelated image as seen in the 1997 PlayStation original - he's been fully rendered in life-like modern graphics. It's been five years since gamers got a first glimpse of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake, when the first trailer dropped. The remake, which is out now, is a completely rebuilt version of a role-playing game that has sold more than 12 million copies worldwide. And fans of the original are excited to make a return to Midgar, the fantasy city where the remake takes place. One of those eagerly awaiting the release is Youtuber Elz the Witch, who says she felt really emotional when she first played the remake. When the title screen came up with the theme music, it looked exactly how I imagined it looking 23 years ago, but with a hundred times better graphics, she tells BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat. I didn't expect to be emotional but it's just that nostalgia of something that you've wanted for so long - and you've grown up with - to see come to fruition is really remarkable. For civil servant Rob Bowman, it helped him understand his sexuality. Cloud is the protagonist and I related to him a lot, he says. In the game, he's trying to figure out who he is, and I was doing the same when I was playing it, although for different reasons. For me, it was figuring out my sexuality. Within the game Cloud found out who he was, and it made him stronger as a result. To this day, I feel it was the same for me. The game helped me open my eyes. Getting the remake right for fans of the original, like Rob and Elz, was important for the development team. Yoshinori Kitase, one of the game's producers, told Newsbeat: You'll really get that that hit of nostalgia as soon as you start playing. There are loads of little moments to recognize and go, 'wow, I really remember this', but it's cool and exciting to see how it's been depicted in in a more modern style. It's been 23 years since the release of the original. That game broke new ground in terms of its visual style and storytelling - and fans have idolised the story and characters. But in the two decades since it was first released, a brand-new generation of gamers has emerged. And that's something the development team were very aware of. This is not just for the players of the original, the remake's director, Naoki Hamaguchi, tells Newsbeat. It's got the same really well-loved core elements to it, but shown with more style, which will really help the game resonate with players today. To do that the team have added story details that were not explored in the original and designed an entirely new way for battles to take place. Yoshinori and Naoki agree it was important to get the balance right between innovating and staying true to the original. Early reviews are positive but it's too early to tell how the game has landed with new players - although Elz is pleased with what she's played. There are always going to be high expectations that the remake is going to be held against, she says. I can only speak for myself and I'm really enjoying with how the gameplay has developed. Rob is still waiting to get his hands on the release after a mix-up with his pre-order. He's struggled with his health in recent years but believes the wait will be worth it. About three years ago I had to have emergency surgery on my heart, it was very likely that I would have died, he says. But I came around and the first thing I thought about, the thing I was most upset about, was the fact that I nearly didn't get to play Final Fantasy 7 Remake.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51644033,Should we teach children about quantum computing?,"Education will be high in the mind of many parents, particularly if they have been grappling with home learning. But what subjects should young people be studying to prepare them for the future? Tim and Kelley McDonald enrolled their son Jack in The Knowledge Society (TKS), a part-time school for teenagers, to give him a chance to learn what he doesn't at traditional school. In my regular school we don't talk about cryptography or quantum computing, it's not in the curriculum, so for years I had to find time to learn that on my own by myself, says 15-year-old Jack, who is enrolled in the inaugural New York cohort of The Knowledge Society's programme. Recently declared as one of the Schools of the Future by the World Economic Forum think-tank, it offers education and training for 13-to-17-year-olds interested in artificial intelligence (AI) and other niche technology subjects rarely if ever taught in mainstream schools. Before The Knowledge Society, Jack, who's one of four siblings and the only one enrolled in TKS, was interested in neuroscience and discussed being a brain surgeon. Classes at TKS have around 40 students and are held two days a week (on weekends) for three hours each day. The 10-month programme is not cheap, it costs between $5,395 and $8225 (£4,395 and £6,700) for the 2020-21 academic year, depending on which city it is held in. Programmes are currently offered in cities across North America, including Boston, Seattle, Los Angeles and Toronto, and TKS is expected to expand into London and Latin America in 2021. (Courses are currently being conducted online because of the coronavirus outbreak.) The Knowledge Society's 2020-21 programme overview highlights 40 areas of focus, which includes learning about 3D printing, bionics, or wireless electricity, with the full programme lasting three years. So should regular schools be offering such ambitious subjects? More Technology of Business Matthew McKean, director of education and skills at the Conference Board of Canada (Canada's leading independent research body) is not sure. We run the risk of teaching young people to use technologies that may be obsolete by the time they enter the workforce, says Mr McKean, adding that human skills, such as communicating and building relationships, are more durable and transferable. And demand for those skills may not be as high as people expect, he argues. How many people actually need to know how to code or program blockchain, for example? Mr McKean argues that automation and emerging technologies will only increase the need for deep human understanding and social skills. Our research confirms that the future of learning and work is social and emotional, not technical. Employers are increasingly asking for human skills, such as social and emotional intelligence, collaboration, creativity, cross-cultural competencies, relationship building, resilience and adaptability, which is placing new demands on our skills training systems, he says. MIT lecturer David Shrier, who's also written books on financial technology and blockchain, thinks schools like The Knowledge Society are great to get kids excited about opportunities in STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and maths). A 13-year-old learning genomics makes for a good headline, he says, but points out the field could be radically different in four years. What will they do then without a strong base of critical thinking? he asks. The Knowledge Society teaches critical thinking too, says co-founder Nadeem Nathoo, noting the course teaches youngsters how to organize and write down their thoughts, as well as learning how to speak confidently to an audience. But he defends the value of studying cutting-edge technical subjects directly. If they were not exposed to this type of content or types of problems at TKS, it would be unrealistic to think to solve them, he says. I think we need to train people on the intention [to solve technical problems] from a young age, and show them these problems exist and they have the power to actually address them. All well and good - but does that impress potential high-tech employers, who will have to choose which talented graduates to hire? Anne Martel is co-founder of Element AI, which adapts artificial intelligence (AI) for use in business. She thinks a high degree of computer literacy and problem solving skills are the most important for children to be equipped with now - and learning about advanced technologies could be a good way to achieve that. When we teach our kids about AI, we teach them a technical language and take them deeper into probability and statistics. I think that is incredibly relevant for their future, she says. While she approves of specialised technology courses like those offered by TKS, she says broader skills are important. Curiosity, creativity and good old-fashioned grit are traits she looks for when hiring for her firm. There are other options for parents who want their children to learn more about technology. Fire Tech focuses on subjects like video game design and 3D game development, while also offering a remote learning option. Meanwhile GEMS World Academy Chicago, like TKS, has a focus on technology and the global community, offering robotics and coding lessons. The Knowledge Society is certainly expensive, and many bright students could expect to excel without shelling out all that money. But Mr Nathoo argues that around half of the pupils gain paid internships which cover the cost of tuition in less than a year. And is it really healthy for teenagers to spend seven days a week studying? I think there's a common misconception that this is like a sweatshop for kids... it's not like that. They love doing this, says Mr Nathoo. There's no pressure on them, but yes, it is for people who want to accelerate their trajectory, and we're going to tap their potential. Jack McDonald's parents say he spends 15 to 20 hours a week on his work from TKS and that's on top of his regular school work. That's definitely not something every child would thrive on. But for Jack, it's more valuable than collectively my entire schooling."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52246319,Coronavirus: Apple and Google team up to contact trace Covid-19,"Apple and Google are jointly developing technology to alert people if they have recently come into contact with others found to be infected with coronavirus. They hope to initially help third-party contact-tracing apps run efficiently. But ultimately, they aim to do away with the need to download dedicated apps, to encourage the practice. The two companies believe their approach - designed to keep users, whose participation would be voluntary, anonymous - addresses privacy concerns. Their contact-tracing method would work by using a smartphone's Bluetooth signals to determine to whom the owner had recently been in proximity for long enough to have established contagion a risk. If one of those people later tested positive for the Covid-19 virus, a warning would be sent to the original handset owner. No GPS location data or personal information would be recorded. Privacy, transparency and consent are of utmost importance in this effort and we look forward to building this functionality in consultation with interested stakeholders, Apple and Google said in a joint statement. We will openly publish information about our work for others to analyse. President Trump said his administration needed time to consider the development. It's very interesting, but a lot of people worry about it in terms of a person's freedom, he said during a White House press conference. We're going to take... a very strong look at it, and we'll let you know pretty soon. The European Union's Data Protection Supervisor sounded more positive, saying: The initiative will require further assessment, however, after a quick look it seems to tick the right boxes as regards user choice, data protection by design and pan-European interoperability. But others have noted that the success of the venture may depend on getting enough people tested. Apple is the developer of iOS. Google is the company behind Android. The two operating systems power the vast majority of smartphones in use. Some countries - including Singapore, Israel, South Korea and Poland - are already using people's handsets to issue coronavirus contagion alerts. Other health authorities - including the UK, France and Germany - are working on initiatives of their own. And some municipal governments in the US are reportedly about to adopt a third-party app. The two technology giants aim to bring coherence to all this by allowing existing third-party apps to be retrofitted to include their solution. This would make the apps interoperable, so contact tracing would continue to work as people travelled overseas and came into contact with people using a different tool. Apple and Google have been working on the effort for about two weeks but have not externally revealed their plans until Friday. If successful, the scheme could help countries relax lockdowns and border restrictions. The companies aim to release a software building-block - known as an API (application programming interface) - by mid-May. This would allow others' apps to run on the same basis. Records of the digital IDs involved would be stored on remote computer servers but the companies say these could not be used to unmask a specific individual's true identity. Furthermore, the contact-matching process would take place on the phones rather than centrally. This would make it possible for someone to be told they should go into quarantine, without anyone else being notified. The two companies have released details of the cryptography specifications they plan to use to safeguard privacy, and details of the role Bluetooth will play. They hope this will convince activists their approach can be trusted. Apple and Google say another benefit of their solution is developers would not risk the iOS and Android versions of their apps becoming incompatible because of a buggy update. In addition, they believe it would be less taxing on battery life than current contact-tracing systems. Phase two of the initiative involves building contact-tracing capabilities into the iOS and Android operating systems. Users could then switch the capability on and off again without having to download an app at all. Approved third-party apps would still be able to interact with the facility if desired. The facility would be delivered via a future system software update. But the companies have yet to say when this would occur. This is a more robust solution, they say, suggesting there would be wider adoption if users did not have to download additional software for themselves. It also provides the companies with the ability to easily disable tracing on a regional basis when the pandemic ends. While Apple and Google hope others will see benefits of adopting their approach, this is not guaranteed. An independent effort - the Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT) initiative - revealed its own attempt to deliver a privacy-centric solution on 1 April. About 130 technologists and scientists are involved and the group has already made contact with several European governments."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52243088,Coronavirus: Google data suggests park visits rose on weekend,"Visits to parks increased last weekend compared to two weeks ago, according to activity data from Google. Overall, its UK report suggests far fewer people have been going out compared to life before lockdown, although visits to parks increased during last weekend's warm weather. The tech giant has released its second set of reports looking at activity in 131 countries during the pandemic. There was also an increase in use of transport hubs and food stores. Google has been collecting location data from people who have opted into Location History tracking. It is using this to produce reports that show how busy areas are compared to a period earlier in the year. The data only shows people's activity in aggregate and not specific individuals' behaviours. But it does offer breakdowns for specific areas - in the case of the UK, on a county-by-county basis. Data for two weeks ago had suggested visits to places such as parks, public beaches and gardens were down 52% compared to life before lockdown. But last weekend, the figure was 29%. There had been concerns that sunny weather would tempt people out, and a number of parks were closed last weekend. In Greater London, the data indicates, visits to parks were down just 15% compared to life before lockdown. Government advice says people can go to the park to exercise, but they should stay 2m (6.6ft) away from others, apart from members of their own household. The full report for the UK has been published on Google's website. More warm weather has been predicted for the Easter bank holiday weekend, and police have warned that they will crack down on those breaking lockdown rules. The report uses data from people who have enabled Location History tracking in their Google account. Google collects location data from their smartphones. It normally does this to provide advice about how busy shops and other attractions are, and whether there is traffic on the road ahead. In this case, it uses the information to gauge how busy places are, compared to life before lockdown. It uses records from the five-week period between 3 January and 6 February 2020 as its baseline for life before lockdown."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51968122,Step-by-step guide: How to video call your family,"If you are self-isolating at home, video-chatting can help you stay in touch with your friends and family. This guide will show you how to make a video call using a smartphone, or receive one using your desktop computer - or help you explain how to do so to others. If your phone is made by OnePlus, Google, Honor, Huawei, LG, Samsung or Sony, it is an Android phone. Several other companies make Android phones too. There are plenty of free apps you can use to make video calls including Google Duo, Facebook Messenger, Skype, WhatsApp and Zoom. This guide will show you how to make a video call using WhatsApp. To video call a friend using WhatsApp, they will need to have installed the app too - and you will need to add their phone number to your smartphone's address book. If you have an iPhone, iPad or Mac computer, you can video call a friend using FaceTime. The app comes pre-installed on all of these devices. However, it only works on Apple devices, so your friend or relative must be using an iPhone, iPad or Mac too. If your friend or relative does not use an iPhone, iPad or Mac, you can still video call them using a different app. You can follow the instructions provided for WhatsApp at the top of this page. You can receive video calls on a desktop computer without installing any software. Some video-calling services such as Skype and Zoom will let you join a chat using your computer's web browser. To do this, you'll need to be invited to a video call by a friend or relative who already has the software installed. Ask them to follow the instructions in the video below, in order to send you an invite link by text message or email. Remember, you should only click on the link if you have spoken to your friend or relative and are expecting it. If you are not expecting an invite, ask your friend or relative to double-check."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-52240251,Coronavirus: Teachers in Singapore stop using Zoom after 'lewd' incidents,"Singapore has suspended the use of video-conferencing tool Zoom by its teachers, after a very serious incident during a home-based lesson. Singapore closed its schools on Wednesday in response to a rising number of coronavirus cases. But one mother told local media that, during her daughter's geography lesson, obscene images appeared on screen, before two men asked girls to flash. Zoom told the BBC the company was deeply upset about the incidents. Zoom recently changed its default settings for home-based learning, and issued a guide for teachers to secure their virtual classrooms. Parents told local media the incidents happened in a geography class for first-year secondary school pupils. About 39 children were in the class when the stream was hacked, before two Caucasian men appeared and made lewd comments. The class was stopped immediately. Home-based learning is supposed to be a safe space, one parent told the Straits Times. I know it's difficult to manage but as a parent I feel very concerned. It's not known how the hackers gained access. Zoom meetings have nine-digit IDs and can, in theory, be joined by any user if they are not protected by the organiser. These are very serious incidents, said Aaron Loh of the government's educational technology division. The Ministry of Education is currently investigating both breaches and will lodge a police report if warranted. As a precautionary measure, our teachers will suspend their use of Zoom until these security issues are ironed out. Mr Loh said the government had spelt out to all our teachers the security measures they must adhere to, including secure log-ins. We have been deeply upset to hear about these types of incidents, a spokesperson said. Zoom strongly condemns such behaviour and we encourage users to report any incidents of this kind directly to Zoom so we can take appropriate action. The company said it had changed default settings, to enable virtual waiting rooms and ensure only hosts can share their screens by default. It has also set up a guide for setting up and securing virtual classrooms. Zoom is a video conferencing tool that went live to the public in 2013. But since the Covid-19 pandemic has caused lockdown around the world, usage of Zoom has ballooned overnight, the company recently said. Until last year, its highest number of daily users was 10 million. In March this year, it reached more than 200m daily users. But that rapid growth has caused problems, with meetings hijacked around the world. A video conference at a US school was recently disrupted by racist remarks, and a local government meeting in Pennsylvania was targeted with pornography In response to the so-called Zoom-bombing, the company said: The first rule of Zoom Club: don't give up control of your screen. You do not want random people in your public event taking control of the screen and sharing unwanted content with the group. More recently, the company said it would spend 90 days dedicating the resources needed to better identify, address, and fix issues proactively."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35547368,Coronavirus: Amazon builds its own testing lab for staff,"Retail giant Amazon says it will build its own coronavirus testing lab to monitor the health of its staff. Cases of Covid-19 have been reported at more than 50 Amazon facilities across the US. Some have involved multiple infected workers. The company said it had assembled a team to build its own incremental testing capacity. Amazon staff have previously criticised the firm over its response to the coronavirus pandemic. In March, Amazon fired a New York warehouse worker who organised a protest over a lack of safety precautions taken by the company. In a statement, Amazon said We did not terminate Mr Smalls' employment for organizing a 15-person protest. We terminated his employment for putting the health and safety of others at risk and violations of his terms of his employment. Mr Smalls received multiple warnings for violating social distancing guidelines. Later, a memo from a meeting of Amazon executives was leaked. It said: We should spend the first part of our response strongly laying out the case for why the organiser's conduct was immoral, unacceptable, arguably illegal, in detail, and only then follow with our usual talking points about worker safety. Amazon blogged it had made more than 150 significant process changes in response to coronavirus. Our operations sites and grocery stores are distributing masks to employees and conducting employee temperature checks, the company said. A next step might be regular testing of all employees, including those showing no symptoms. Regular testing on a global scale across all industries would both help keep people safe and help get the economy back up and running. The company acknowledged that testing resources were limited, so it had assembled a team of employees to develop its own facility. We have begun assembling the equipment we need to build our first lab and hope to start testing small numbers of our front line employees soon. We are not sure how far we will get in the relevant timeframe, but we think it's worth trying, and we stand ready to share anything we learn with others. According to news site Bloomberg, at least one Amazon facility is being investigated by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration over concerns it has not done enough to safeguard employees. The Pennsylvania warehouse receives products from manufacturer before sending them to smaller Amazon warehouses around the US."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52228046,Coronavirus: Ofcom formally probes David Icke TV interview,"The UK's media watchdog has launched a formal investigation into a TV network's broadcast of an interview with conspiracy theorist David Icke about coronavirus. Ofcom acted after London Live screened the programme on Wednesday evening. The regulator received more than 40 complaints following the broadcast. It follows YouTube's introduction of stricter misinformation rules after a later interview with Mr Icke by the same team was streamed on its platform. We have assessed this programme, and we are concerned that it raises potential issues under our rules, said a spokesman for Ofcom. We are now investigating as a matter of urgency. It intends to speak to London Live as part of the probe, and said it was making the investigation a priority. Ofcom is unable to intervene before a programme has been broadcast. But afterwards, it has the power to demand on-air corrections and issue fines. It can even withdraw a TV station's licence to broadcast, but seldom does so. Earlier, the culture secretary had expressed concern about the matter on BBC Radio 4's Today programme Clearly that station is regulated by Ofcom. And I would be expecting Ofcom to take appropriate action, said Oliver Dowden. Clearly they are independent but I will be in touch with them to understand what action they are taking in respect to that. A spokeswoman for London Live: We are aware of the culture secretary's comments, and have proactively contacted Ofcom to offer our co-operation and support as part of their assessment. Last week, the watchdog sanctioned a community radio station for having broadcast a discussion that contained potentially harmful views about coronavirus. During the current pandemic, it's important that potentially misleading information about the coronavirus is not broadcast on radio or TV, Ofcom said at the time. This includes inaccurate claims about potential causes, symptoms, and treatments for the virus. London Live's programme was produced by a London-based independent company that also offers training services. On Tuesday, YouTube deleted copies of a later interview with Mr Icke by the same host - which was embedded into the production company's site and hosted on YouTube's platform - and announced it would wipe any other videos that also falsely linked Covid-19 to 5G mobile networks. The production company then reuploaded this interview to another US-based service - Vimeo - but it too deleted it. Vimeo is committed to eliminating content from our platform that spreads harmful health misinformation, said a spokesman. Our policies explicitly reflect these values. After careful review from our Trust & Safety team, we can confirm that the video in question has been removed. It has since been uploaded again to Bitchute, a smaller UK-based platform. Mr Icke does not mention 5G by name in the interview broadcast by London Live, although at one point he does refer to an electro-magnetic technologically generated soup of radiation toxicity, which he claims has damaged old people's immune systems. Scientists have previously rubbished suggestions mobile networks cause such harm. London Live is owned by the Russian businessman Evgeny Lebedev, who also owns the Evening Standard and Independent newspapers. It screened a notice during advert breaks, saying the views expressed in the programme were not necessarily those of the network and displayed the address of the government's Covid-19 website."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52245992,Tech Tent: Social media fights a fresh flood of fake news,"From conspiracy theories linking 5G networks to the coronavirus, to misleading advice about the best way to battle Covid-19, social media sites have been awash with misinformation again. On the Tech Tent podcast this week, we look at the pressure on the likes of Facebook, WhatsApp and YouTube to do more to stem the flow of falsehoods. At first it seemed we could laugh off or ignore some of the outlandish falsehoods about the coronavirus spreading across the internet: that it did not exist; that it was engineered in a lab in China, or perhaps the United States; that it was all part of a plan by Bill Gates to insert microchips in our brains to control us. But it has become clear such misinformation can have damaging effects. Researchers at King's College London questioned people about Covid-19 conspiracy theories, such as the false idea the virus was linked to the rollout of 5G mobile phone networks. And they found those who believed them were less likely to believe there was a good reason for the lockdown in the UK, with potentially damaging effects on health if they chose to ignore government instructions. In the past week, there have also been arson attacks on phone masts, apparently inspired by the conspiracy theories. Campaigns against 5G have been around for a while, with plenty of Facebook groups in the UK lobbying local councils to ban the new networks on health grounds, despite a lack of evidence they could cause harm. Then in late January, the idea 5G might be linked to the coronavirus started popping up on some of these groups. The idea was even featured in a couple of newspaper articles. While the social networks have previously been content to allow misinformation about 5G or vaccines or various conspiracy theories, this week they began to act. WhatsApp made it harder to forward all kinds of stories, while YouTube brought in a policy of deleting video linking symptoms of Covid-19 to 5G. Among the first videos to be taken down was a lengthy interview with the conspiracy theorist David Icke. Emily Bell, director of the Tow Centre for Digital Journalism, at New York's Columbia University, tells Tech Tent there is a good reason the companies have taken a harder line. The pressure has been intense, not least because this is much more directly correlated to outcomes which affect life and death, she says. If people don't take the science seriously, if they don't do what they're being asked to do in terms of social distancing, then people die. In the past, Facebook has come under fire from American conservatives for alleged bias when it has moved to ban people or limit the spread of misinformation. But for now, while a few free-speech advocates are pushing back against the crackdown on the conspiracy theorists, the social media companies are facing far less opposition than when they have silenced figures from the extreme right. A far bigger problem, as Emily Bell points out, is dealing with the sheer volume of misinformation about the virus flowing across the various platforms. What I hear from all of them is that they still don't really have the internal mechanisms to deal with the tsunami of false information that they're currently seeing, she says. The other question is whether it is ever possible to change the minds of people convinced 5G caused the coronavirus, or vaccines are deadly, or Apollo 11 never landed on the Moon. Some argue that rather than banning such material, the answer is to provide rigorous fact-checking and detailed scientific information. But, having spent far too much time in recent weeks lurking in various conspiratorial Facebook groups, I am not so sure. A member of one such group posted a message explaining how to type in the words fact check and fact checker into Facebook's settings, so all such material was blocked. Facts, it seems, are not required by those pushing eccentric and damaging narratives."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52251286,Coronavirus: Raspberry Pi-powered ventilator to be tested in Colombia,"A team in Colombia is to test a ventilator made with a Raspberry Pi computer and easy-to-source parts. The design and computer code were posted online in March by a man in California, who had no prior experience at creating medical equipment. Marco Mascorro, a robotics engineer, said he built the ventilator because knew the machines were in high demand to treat Covid-19. His post prompted a flood of feedback from healthcare workers. He has used the advice to make improvements. I am a true believer that technology can solve a lot of the problems we have right now specifically in this pandemic, he told the BBC. The Colombian team said the design was important for their South American country because parts for traditional models could be hard to obtain. By contrast, Mr Mascorro's design uses only easy-to-find parts - for example, the valves it employs can commonly be found at car and plumbing supply stores. The machine is set to be put through a fast-tracked round of tests at two institutions in Bogota - the University Hospital of the Pontifical Xavierian University and Los Andes University. The fight against Covid-19 is like a race, said Omar Ramirez, who will lead the effort. All the world is competing against the disease, but on different tracks and what determines those different tracks is the access to resources and experience. The Raspberry Pi plays a key role in the ventilator. The British invention is a small, low-cost computer board, which was originally created to help teach computer coding. But over the past eight years it has been embraced by enthusiasts and others to form the brains of a wide range of electronics projects. Having a computer to control the ventilator is critical. It sets the air pressure, opens and closes valves, and can regulate whether a patient needs full or partial breathing assistance. Mr Mascorro has made the code involved open source, meaning that anyone can use it or modify it without charge. The beauty of developing a software-centric system is we can make changes to the processes without doing much to the hardware, he explained. The equipment will run non-stop for five days ventilating a set of artificial lungs, as part of the tests. If it passes them, the machine will be undergo animal trials. The Colombian group hopes to then make a start on human trials at the beginning of May. And if they too are a success, the aim is to start using mass-produced versions on hospital patients by the middle of the year, The timeline reflects the urgency with which Colombia's authorities are treating the matter. Testing and gaining regulatory permission to deploy such equipment would normally take about 18 months. But some doctors remain unconvinced the machine will be up to the task, at least during the current outbreak. Anything that can provide a backup can be helpful, but it has to be properly tested to see if it can deliver the oxygen and pressure support, said Dr Albert Rizzo, chief medical officer for the American Lung Association. Dr Rizzo added, however, that the project had the potential to eventually yield trustworthy ventilators which could be used during future pandemics."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52200045,Climate change: UK forests 'could do more harm than good',"Mass tree planting in the UK could harm the environment if not planned properly, a report warns. Badly-planned trees would increase greenhouse gas emissions, say the government’s advisers on the economic value of the natural environment. The report comes from the Natural Capital Committee (NCC), which says planting trees into peat bogs would prove a serious mistake. Peat locks up vast quantities of carbon - but trees dry out peat. This can release more greenhouse gases than the trees absorb. One NCC member, Prof Ian Bateman from the University of Exeter, said: “The mantra has to be ‘the right tree in the right place’.“ “We would be crazy to undertake the massive scale of planting being considered if we did not also consider the wider effects upon the environment including impacts on wildlife, benefits in terms of reducing flood risks and effects on water quality, improvements to recreation and so on.” Will millions more trees really stop climate change? Right trees in right places The report adds that carpeting upland pastures with trees would reduce the UK’s ability to produce meat – which may lead to increasing imports from places that produce beef by felling rainforests. It also makes a similar point on industry. There’s no point closing dirty UK factories, the authors say, if we’re then going to import goods from places with worse emissions. The authors note that huge publicity has been given to the UK’s plans for planting 11 million trees to lock up carbon emissions, but they warn that conserving carbon in soils is equally or more important. The report points out that the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that in 2007 UK soils contained approximately 4,019 million tonnes of carbon (MtC), that’s 94.2% of the total stock of biological carbon - excluding fossil fuel carbon. They say soil degradation through erosion, intensive farming and development creates losses estimated at between £0.9 –1.4bn per year for England and Wales alone. Soils underpin everything Prof Kathy Willis from Oxford University and an NCC member, told BBC News: “We love looking at trees – we get all these positive emotions, smells and sounds – but most of us don't look at soil that actually underpins everything.” The NCC calls for much better monitoring of soils. And it says that farming on lowland peat such as the rich fields of East Anglia should be halted if soil there continues to be lost. This recommendation may be strongly resisted by farmers, although some of them say they’re addressing the problem by using “cover crops” to bind the soil together while cash crops are being planted. Mark Bridgeman, president of the Country Land and Business Association (CLA) told BBC News: You improve soil by taking good care of it - reducing ploughing and using organic manure for example. You do not just give up and stop farming the land - particularly at a time when the country is becoming increasingly reliant on high quality, locally produced food. The NCC notes previous reports projecting a reduction in the consumption of amount of red meat and dairy produce by at least 20% per person and reducing food waste by 20%. This implies around a 10% reduction in cattle and sheep numbers by 2050, compared with 2017 levels. The report outlines the scale of the challenge for measures taken to tackle climate change through land use policies in the UK. It says: “These figures make it clear that – far from being an option for major offsetting of emissions from other sectors – the measures will not even mitigate the emissions of the agriculture, land use and peatlands sectors.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52111309,Climate change: Warming clips the nightingale's wings,"Rising temperatures may be having a profound physical impact on one of the world's favourite songbirds. Researchers in Spain found that over a 20-year period, nightingales had evolved smaller wingspans. The scientists say this is linked to a changing climate in the region which has seen the early onset of spring and increased drought. They are concerned that this could affect the bird's ability to migrate in winter. Famed for its ability to sing, the nightingale has a very rich repertoire as it is able to produce over 1,000 different sounds, compared to just 340 by skylarks. Although common in many parts of Europe and Asia, the bird is mainly seen and heard in southern England. Numbers here have declined markedly over the last half century, down 90%, with multiple factors to blame including deer eating their preferred nesting sites, but also because of a changing climate. The nightingale spends the winter in sub-Saharan Africa, with the small, brown creature clocking up huge distances during migration. Wing size is critical to this endeavour. Now,, researchers say that ability to migrate may be impeded by climate change. Scientists in Spain have studied 20 years of data on wing shape in two populations of the birds. They found that the average wing length of the nightingales relative to their body size has decreased. They believe this is related to changes in temperatures seen in the Mediterranean region. Our results show that spring is delayed and the intensity of the summer drought is higher, which means a shorter optimal breeding period for the birds, said Dr Carolina Remacha, from Madrid's Complutense University, who led the study. We find the unique possibility that shorter wings are being favoured. The researchers believe that birds like the nightingale normally adapt to the demands of migration by having longer wings, having a larger clutch size but a shorter lifespan. However, the changing temperatures are interfering with this and provoking a response from the birds. Faced with a shorter breeding season, the researchers believe the most successful birds are having smaller families with smaller wings. They argue that these adaptations are likely to come at a price. If these changes are the response to the new environment, then obviously the ones that have been selected, the ones with shorter wings, are the optimal nightingales for the new situation, said co-author Prof Javier Perez-Tris also from Complutense University. These are not the best wings for migration, but the shorter wings come in the same package. The researchers say that the birds are continuing with the same migration patterns and destinations and therefore their survival is likely to be reduced. While the scientists say this maladaptation is evident in the birds they have studied in Spain where there have been droughts in the summer, it may also be impacting other members of the species in different regions. If the climate is changing in a similar way, and the pressures are similar than you'd expect similar responses, said Dr Perez-Tris. The research has been published in The Auk: Ornithological Advances. Follow Matt on Twitter."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52125309,Coronavirus: Putting the spotlight on the global wildlife trade,"Conservation experts say the coronavirus pandemic, which likely originated at a market selling wild animals in China, is a watershed moment for curbing the global wildlife trade, which can drive extinction and spread disease. When Adam Peyman walked into a restaurant in Vietnam to order a meal he was shocked to find wild animals, including threatened species, on the menu, alongside traditional rice, noodles and seafood. Sting ray, porcupine, softshell turtle, wild pig and wild goat were all on offer. It was a bit of a surprise to see these foods, says the wildlife manager for the animal welfare organisation, Humane Society International. But, these kinds of wild foods are considered something of a luxury. Feasting on exotic game has become a sign of status and wealth in some Asian countries. The desire for wildlife as food or medicine drives a trade in wild animals, some procured illegally, creating a breeding ground for disease and the chance for viruses to leap to humans. The consumption of wild animals, especially wild mammals, which can carry diseases that can cross the species barrier, does pose a real threat to human health, says Mr Peyman. It's hard to tell whether these animals are taken from the wild legally or not, some of them could have been smuggled in and then sold on these wet markets, as they're called. Wet markets have become a familiar sight in many countries in Southeast Asia, particularly mainland China. Selling live fish, chickens and wildlife, as well as fresh fruit and vegetables, they get their name from the melting ice used to preserve goods, as well as to wash the floors clean of blood from butchered animals. Wet markets can be timebombs for epidemics, says Prof Andrew Cunningham, deputy director of science at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL). This sort of way that we treat... animals as if they're just our commodities for us to plunder - it comes back to bite us and it's no surprise. The current coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed tens of thousands of lives, likely originated in the Wuhan seafood market. Despite its name, the market was selling a lot more than fish, including snakes, porcupine and deer, according to one report. After an initial cluster of cases connected to the market, the virus began spreading dramatically inside China, before reaching much of the world. The origins of the novel virus are unknown, but it most likely emerged in a bat, then made the leap to humans via another wild animal host. Scientists have for decades been drawing attention to outbreaks of human diseases that have originated in animals, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) and Ebola. The message from the New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society is clear: ban live animal markets that trade in wildlife, stop illegal trafficking and poaching of wild animals. Not only will this help prevent the spread of disease, it will address one of the major drivers of species extinction, says the society. In the wake of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China introduced a ban on all farming and consumption of live wildlife, which is expected to become law later this year. Thousands of wildlife farms raising animals such as porcupines, civets and turtles have been shut down. However, loopholes remain, such as the trade in wild animals for medicine, pets and scientific research. Then there is the traditional Chinese medicines industry, which also uses wildlife products. Only recently, the Chinese government appears to have approved the use of an injection - ironically as a coronavirus treatment - that contains bear bile. Campaigners worry these exemptions could pave way for illegal trade on wildlife meat, as it did in the past with, for instance, tiger and leopard body parts. So pangolin meat could still be available as the animal's scales can be used for medicine and its nails as ornaments. All eyes, therefore, are on the soon-to-be amended wildlife protection law - whether and how it would address those loopholes. In neighbouring Vietnam, the government is rushing through legislation to clamp down on illegal wildlife trade at street markets and online. But some say it won't be easy to change cultural attitudes or to enforce bans, when wet markets are part of the local culture, with the belief that the meat sold there is fresh and cheap. Prof Dirk Pfeiffer of City University of Hong Kong says the real issue is demand. The people who are providing them, whether that's farmed wild animals or animals from the wild, that's an important source of income for them. Pushing it underground, that's not the solution, so it needs to be a phased process. This isn't the first time a pandemic has put the spotlight on wildlife trade. The 2002 Sars outbreak, which started in China and claimed more than 700 lives, was linked to bats and mongoose-like civets, although the source was never confirmed. Prof Cunningham says if we're to stop another pandemic in the future, we must focus on causes as well as effects. At the root of the problem is the destruction of nature, bringing animals and humans into conflict. Even in protected forests, the forests are still there, but the wildlife's gone from within them because they have ended up in markets, he says. .And it's easy to finger point, but it's not just happening in China, it's happening in many other countries and even in the western world. We like to have exotic pets and many of those are wild caught and we ought to be putting our own house in order too. Additional reporting Navin Singh Khadka Follow Helen on Twitter."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52177586,Coronavirus: Tiger at Bronx Zoo tests positive for Covid-19,"A four-year-old female Malayan tiger at the Bronx Zoo has tested positive for the coronavirus. The tiger, named Nadia, is believed to be the first known case of an animal infected with Covid-19 in the US. The Bronx Zoo, in New York City, says the test result was confirmed by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Iowa. Nadia, along with six other big cats, is thought to have been infected by an asymptomatic zoo keeper. The cats started showing symptoms, including a dry cough, late last month after exposure to the employee, who has not been identified. This is the first time that any of us know of anywhere in the world that a person infected the animal and the animal got sick, Paul Calle, the chief veterinarian at the zoo, told Reuters news agency on Sunday. There have been isolated instances of pets testing positive for the coronavirus elsewhere in the world, but experts have stressed there is no evidence they can become sick or spread the disease. Mr Calle said he intends to share the findings with other zoos and institutions researching the transmission of Covid-19. We tested the cat [Nadia] out of an abundance of caution and will ensure any knowledge we gain about Covid-19 will contribute to the world's continuing understanding of this novel coronavirus, the zoo said in a statement. Nadia, her sister Azul, as well as two Amur tigers and three African lions who showed symptoms, are all expected to make a full recovery, the zoo said. The big cats did have some decrease in appetite but are otherwise doing well under veterinary care and are bright, alert, and interactive with their keepers, it said. The zoo said it is not known how the virus will develop in animals like tigers and lions since various species can react differently to new infections, but all the animals will be closely monitored. None of the zoo's other big cats are showing any signs of illness. All the tigers showing symptoms were housed in the zoo's Tiger Mountain area. It is unclear if the others will be tested. All four zoos run by the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York City, including the Bronx Zoo, have been closed to the public since 16 March. New measures will now be put in place to protect the animals and their caretakers at all the facilities. This coronavirus was first detected in humans in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. The coronavirus (called Sars-CoV-2, which causes the disease Covid-19) is thought to have originated in wildlife and been passed to humans via a live animal market in Wuhan. The pandemic has been driven by human-to-human transmission, but the infection of Nadia raises new questions about human-to-animal transmission. There have been less than a handful of isolated reports of companion animals testing positive for coronavirus, including two dogs in Hong Kong. There is no evidence that any person has been infected with Covid-19 in the US by animals, including by pet dogs or cats, the zoo's statement noted. That is also the view of the World Organisation for Animal Health and the World Health Organization (WHO), which says there is no evidence that pet dogs or cats can pass on the coronavirus. The World Organisation for Animal Health says studies are under way to understand the issue more. and urges anyone who has become sick to limit contact with pets. Dr Sarah Caddy, Veterinarian and Clinical Research Fellow at the University of Cambridge, is among experts to respond to the reports. It is surprising that the tiger has become infected with what must have been a fairly low dose of virus - we can assume the tiger did not have continual close contact with the asymptomatic zoo keeper, she said about the transmission. It is also interesting that the tiger showed clinical signs consistent with Covid-19 in humans. Although scientific proof is lacking, the chance this is just a coincidence is low. Conservation experts have warned that the virus could pose a threat to some wildlife like the great apes - and have said measures are needed to reduce the risk of wild gorillas, chimps and orangutans."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52190502,"Coronavirus: Don't bail out airlines, say climate campaigners","More than 250 trades unions and environment groups have signed an open letter opposing plans for bailing out the aviation industry. The letter to governments demands that any bailouts lead to better labour conditions and a cut in emissions. They say aviation should make changes already evident in other sectors amid the coronavirus lockdown. Thanks to a long-standing treaty, international aviation has largely been able to make its own rules. The campaigners say this must change now that firms are asking for new favours from governments Their informal group is called “Stay Grounded”. Its spokesperson Magdalena Heuwieser said: “For decades the aviation industry has avoided contributing meaningfully to global climate goals and resisted the merest suggestion of taxes on fuel or tickets. “Now, airlines, airports and manufacturers are demanding huge and unconditional taxpayer-backed bailouts. We cannot let the aviation industry get away with privatising profits in the good times, and expect the public to pay for its losses in the bad times.” The aviation association IATA has conducted what it calls an “aggressive” global campaign aimed at persuading governments to introduce measures softening the effect of the virus emergency. It’s asking for the immediate reduction of all charges and taxes; deferral of any planned increases in charges and taxes for 6-12 months; and the creation of funds to help airlines restart or maintain routes. It says without such measures, many airlines will go bankrupt – leading to the loss of routes and damage to the economy, as well as thousands of job losses. Several nations have agreed to some of the industry's demands but in the UK the Chancellor Rishi Sunak has told airlines to look to its own shareholders to keep them running. UK airports, meanwhile, are asking ministers to grant them a suspension of Air Passenger Duty and other measures when the crisis is over. Stay Grounded has a very different recipe for a successful outcome at the end of the crisis. It wants a focus on protecting workers not shareholders; making aviation firms contribute to emissions reductions by cutting air travel demand and strengthening low-carbon alternatives like rail travel; while imposing a kerosene tax and progressive levies on frequent flying. Pablo Muñoz from the Spanish organisation Ecologistas en Acción, said: “While we are rightly focused on saving lives during the immediate health threat of, our governments have a choice: they can hand taxpayers’ money to corporations unconditionally, or they can seize the opportunity to start building an economy which doesn’t harm people or the planet”. This touches on a much deeper debate about the nature of the post-Covid recovery. There’s a gulf between people who want to use the crisis for a green stimulus to the economy, whilst others warn that so much money will have been spent conquering the virus that there will be little left for clean energy investment.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52264743,Apollo 13: Enhanced images reveal life on stricken spacecraft,"Image enhancement techniques have been used to reveal life aboard Nasa's stricken Apollo 13 spacecraft in unprecedented detail. Fifty years ago, the craft suffered an explosion that jeopardised the lives of the three astronauts aboard. Unsurprisingly, given they were locked in a fight for survival, relatively few onboard images were taken. But imaging specialist Andy Saunders created sharp stills from low-quality 16mm film shot by the crew. One of the techniques used by Mr Saunders is known as stacking, in which many frames are assembled on top of each other to improve the image's detail. Crewed by Nasa astronauts Jim Lovell, Jack Swigert and Fred Haise, Apollo 13 was supposed to be the third American mission to land on the lunar surface. During the journey to the Moon, an explosion in the service module allowed some of the spacecraft's oxygen to leak out into space. Astronaut Jack Swigert reported the accident to ground controllers with the immortal, and much misquoted, phrase: Okay, Houston, we've had a problem here. The part of the Apollo spacecraft designed to return the astronauts through Earth's atmosphere after the mission - the command module (CM) - had to be shut down to conserve its remaining resources for re-entry. The crew had to use the lunar module (LM) - also known as the lander - as a lifeboat. The lander's life support systems were designed for two astronauts living for two days on the lunar surface. Experts at Nasa's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, had to figure out a way to stretch its resources so that it could support three crew members for four days. Lovell, Swigert and Haise looped around the Moon and back to Earth in a cold, damp module with limited drinking water. Luckily, the improvised plan to get them back was a success, and the three astronauts splashed down safely into the Pacific Ocean. Despite their grave predicament, the crew used a 16mm film camera to record scenes of life aboard the spacecraft. But the footage is of low quality by today's standards. It is this footage that Mr Saunders used as the basis of his enhanced images, which reveal new insights into the crew's fight for survival aboard the damaged spacecraft. A composite panorama of the lunar module lifeboat shows Commander Jim Lovell's attempts at normality by selecting some music on a tape player, while command module pilot Jack Swigert takes a nap in the storage area. Another, dubbed Happy crew by Mr Saunders, captures Lovell and Swigert in apparent high spirits. One striking thing about the 16mm footage is how calm the crew appear, given the grave nature of the situation, the conditions, and the critical mission tasks that lay ahead, Mr Saunders told BBC News. This perhaps belies their true feelings as we know that, in reality, the crew doubted if they would make it home alive. The crew members are eating in the scene. The freeze-dried food relied on mixing it with hot water, but only cold water was available. Lovell later admitted he had eaten little in the days following the accident, losing 6kg (14lb) in weight. A panorama of the dark, powered-down command module was produced from footage shot by Fred Haise when he went to check it out before the rest of the crew moved back in for the risky return through the Earth's atmosphere. In an interview for a new Nasa documentary called Apollo 13: Home Safe, Haise recalls how damp it was in the CM. The astronauts had to wipe down the panels with towels because of a concern that the water could cause an electrical short that could lead to a fire. This would have been catastrophic in the spacecraft's enclosed environment. Two concepts are important for understanding the technique used to process the images: signal - the parts of the image that are desirable to keep - and noise - the unwanted parts of the image. Mr Saunders started by stacking different frames of the same scene on top of one another. It all hinges on the principle that stacking images improves the signal-to-noise ratio, Mr Saunders explained. He added: As the noise in each frame is truly random, then stacking multiple frames of the same scene on top of each other and averaging out the levels of each aligned pixel has the effect of identifying and reducing noise whilst maintaining signal (the signal will be present on all frames). This ultimately boosts the detail, along with overall image quality, making it more photo-like. But because he was dealing with moving pictures, Mr Saunders had to re-align multiple parts of the image, combining all the results into one final picture. These combined images are made up of more than 20 sections stitched together, with each section consisting of a stack of up to 75 separate processed frames, revealing the crew and spacecraft in unprecedented detail. Using commercial software, he then enhanced the photos; adjusting the contrast, correcting the colour and removing some of the fish-eye effect resulting from the wide angle lens that was needed to capture events in such a confined space. More restored images from the Apollo missions, including those from the Apollo 13, can be viewed on Andy Saunders' Twitter feed. Follow Paul on Twitter."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52267383,"50,000-year-old string found at France Neanderthal site","A piece of 50,000-year-old string - the oldest yet discovered - found in a cave in France has cast further doubt on the idea that Neanderthals were cognitively inferior to modern humans. A study published in Scientific Reports said a tiny, three-ply cord fragment made from bark was spotted on a stone tool recovered from the Abri du Maras. It implies that Neanderthals understood concepts like pairs, sets and numbers. Twisted fibres provide the basis for clothes, bags, nets and even boats. Neanderthals - whose species died out about 40,000 years ago - are already known to have made birch bark tar, art and shell beads. They also controlled fire, lived in shelters, were skilled hunters of large animals and deliberately buried their dead in graves. Typically, archaeologists and paleoanthropologists only find faunal remains or stone tools at sites like the Abri du Maras. Perishable materials are usually missing. But a team of researchers from France, the US and Spain discovered a fragment of cord adhering to the underside of a 60mm- (2.4-inch-) long stone tool. The cord, believed to have been made with the inner bark of a conifer tree, was approximately 6.2mm long and 0.5mm wide. Three groups of fibres were separated and twisted clockwise in an S-twist. Once twisted, the strands were twined anti-clockwise in Z-twist to form a cord. The study - whose lead author was Bruce Hardy of Kenyon College in Ohio - concluded that the production of the cord demonstrated that Neanderthals had a detailed ecological understanding of trees and how to transform them into entirely different functional substances. The production of the cord also implied a cognitive understanding of numeracy and context-sensitive operational memory, according to the study. That is because it required keeping track of multiple, sequential operations simultaneously. Given the ongoing revelations of Neanderthal art and technology, it is difficult to see how we can regard Neanderthals as anything other than the cognitive equals of modern humans, the study said."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52122447,"Oceans can be successfully restored by 2050, say scientists","Despite being treated as humanity's rubbish dump for decades, the oceans of the world are proving remarkably resilient, says a new scientific review. Building on that resilience could lead to a full recovery within three decades, the researchers argue. Climate change, and the challenges of scaling up existing conservation efforts, are the big hurdles, they say. The researchers caution that the window for action is now very narrow. The oceans have been exploited by humans for centuries, but the negative impacts of our involvement have only become clear over the last 50 years or so. Fish and other marine species have been hunted almost to extinction, while oil spills and other forms of pollution have poisoned the seas. Over the last few decades, the growing influence of climate change has bleached corals, and seen the ocean's acidity increase. This was documented in last year's special report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This new review recognises the scale of the problems but also points to the remarkable resilience of the seas. Humpback whale numbers have rebounded since the ban on commercial whaling. The proportion of marine species assessed as threatened with global extinction by the IUCN has dropped from 18% in 2000 to 11.4% in 2019. Our study documents the recovery of marine populations, habitats and ecosystems following past conservation interventions. It provides specific, evidence-based recommendations to scale proven solutions globally, said lead author Carlos Duarte, who is professor of marine science at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Thuwal, Saudi Arabia. We know what we ought to do to rebuild marine life, and we have evidence that this goal can be achieved within three decades. Indeed, this requires that we accelerate our efforts, and spread them to areas where efforts are currently modest. The researchers identified nine components that are key to rebuilding the oceans: salt marshes, mangroves, seagrasses, coral reefs, kelp, oyster reefs, fisheries, megafauna and the deep ocean. The scientists recommend a range of actions that are required including protecting species, harvesting wisely and restoring habitats. We now have the skills and expertise to be able to restore vital marine habitats such as oyster reefs, mangrove swamps and salt marshes - which keep our seas clean, our coasts protected and provide food to support entire ecosystems, said co-author Prof Callum Roberts from the University of York, UK. Science gives us reason to be optimistic about the future of our oceans, but we are not currently doing enough in the UK or globally, he added. A big challenge is climate change, which is raising sea levels and making the waters more acidic. The amount of warming that has already taken place will likely make rebuilding tropical reefs quite difficult. If we don't tackle climate change and raise the ambition and immediacy of these efforts, we risk wasting our efforts, said Prof Duarte. We also need to move closer toward reducing pressure on fish stocks, and tackle elements of pollution, such as plastic litter, Another big question is money. The new study estimates that it will costs $10-20bn a year to rebuild marine life by 2050. But the review also points out that for every dollar invested, the expected return would be $10. The authors acknowledge that governments have many other issues on their minds right now but they believe that rescuing the oceans is a very achievable goal. Failure to embrace this challenge, and in doing so condemning our grandchildren to a broken ocean unable to support high quality livelihoods is not an option, added Prof Duarte. The study has been published in the journal Nature. Follow Matt on Twitter."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52204614,Event Horizon Telescope: Black hole produces twisting jet,"One year on from publishing the first ever image of a black hole, the team behind that historic breakthrough is back with a new picture. This time we're being shown the base of a colossal jet of excited gas, or plasma, screaming away from another black hole at near light-speed. The scene was actually in the background of the original target. The scientists who operate the Event Horizon Telescope describe the jet in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics. They say their studies of the region of space known as 3C 279 will help them better understand the physics that drives behaviour in the vicinity of black holes. 3C 279 is what astronomers term a quasar - the extremely bright core of a very distant galaxy. This one is about 5.5 billion light-years from Earth. It is well known, and was used as the calibration target to align the performance of the EHT's eight individual radio telescopes when they simultaneously made their astonishing map of the supermassive black hole at the centre of Galaxy M87. The remarkable resolution achieved by the EHT - put to such great effect with M87 - pays dividends again with 3C 279, because we see previously unrecognised features. 3C 279 also has a supermassive black hole at its heart. It's about one billion times the mass of our Sun and its gravity is pulling in and shredding any stars or gas that get too close. This material is likely being accreted on to a disc that winds around the hole, but some of it is being shot back out into space along two jets moving in opposite directions. In previous images of 3C 279, we've been able to detect the outline of the jet that moves towards us (the one moving in the opposite direction is not detected). But in the new EHT picture, we can resolve detail close to the point where this jet leaves the black hole. What's more, this base area seems twisted and somewhat offset from the main axis of the jet. It's curious, said EHT Collaboration member Dr Ziri Younsi. We're seeing a region that's actually pretty close to the black hole. It could be an interaction layer where the jet couples to the accretion disc and extracts all of its energy from the black hole. We don't really understand how jets are powered by black holes. Black holes, when they rotate rapidly, are the most efficient liberators of energy in the Universe, but the mechanism by which the jet can extract that energy is unknown. There are a few ideas, but we're not sure yet which one is the right one, the University College London, UK, researcher told BBC News. The data in the images of M87 and 3C 279 was collected by the ENT's widely dispersed array of radio telescopes in 2017. The project has gone on to collect data on the supermassive black hole that exists at the centre of our own galaxy, the Milky Way. We have that data - of a region we call Sagittarius A*, said Dr Younsi. We are working on it right now and although we have some preliminary results, these can't be shared just yet. We hope to have something perhaps before the end of this year. The team finds itself in a position to concentrate on this analysis because the observational time it had booked on the EHT array for this year got cancelled in the coronavirus outbreak. A PDF of the A&A paper describing 3C 279 is available here. Its lead author is Dr Jae-Young Kim from the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn, Germany. The Event Horizon Telescope is a virtual telescope that links a large array of radio receivers - from the South Pole, to Hawaii, to the Americas and Europe. It uses a technique called very long baseline array interferometry (VLBI). This combines the observations from the dispersed network to mimic a telescope aperture that can produce the resolution necessary to perceive a pinprick on the sky. For the EHT, this pinprick is measured in microarcseconds. To convey such performance to the general public, EHT team-members talk about the sharpness of vision as being the equivalent of seeing from Earth something the size of a grapefruit on the surface of the Moon.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52236493,Coronavirus: Great apes on lockdown over threat of disease,"Great apes have been put on lockdown against the threat of coronavirus. Gorilla tourism in Africa has been suspended, while sanctuaries for other apes, such as orangutans, have closed to the public. It's not known if great apes can contract the virus, but there are growing fears that our closest living relatives might be equally at risk. This week a tiger at Bronx Zoo tested positive for coronavirus. New measures have been put in place to protect big cats and their caregivers. Dr Kirsten Gilardi is chief veterinary officer for Gorilla Doctors, which provides veterinary care to gorillas in the forests of Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. We don't know if it's infected mountain gorillas; we have not seen any evidence of that, she said. But because mountain gorillas are susceptible to human pathogens, we know that they can develop respiratory illness. Mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) are an endangered species of great ape found only in the forests of Rwanda, Uganda and the DR Congo. All three countries have seen human cases of coronavirus, with gorilla tourism currently suspended. The work of vets and rangers who care for wild gorillas continues, but with added precautions. Much of what we're practicing right now, in terms of social distancing, and self-quarantine, are at the heart of the recommendations for protecting great apes as well, said Dr Gilardi, who is also a veterinary professor at the University of California, Davis. Even before the outbreak, people were asked to stay seven metres away from gorillas at all times. New guidance from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) calls for a minimum distance of 10 metres from great apes, with visits by humans reduced to the minimum needed to ensure their safety and health. No person who is ill, or who has been in contact with a sick person in the preceding 14 days, should be allowed near them. Habitat loss and poaching are big threats to the survival of great apes, but viruses are also a concern. Infectious disease is now listed among the top three threats to some great ape groups. Past research has shown that chimps can contract the common cold virus, while the Ebola virus is thought to have killed thousands of chimpanzees and gorillas in Africa. Serge Wich, professor of primate biology at Liverpool John Moores University, UK, said many governments had closed down tourism with great apes, while researchers and sanctuaries were taking extra measures. He said: We don't know, if they were to get infected, what the health effects would be, but obviously given the health implications for people it's a risk we do not want to take with great apes so these precautions everyone's taking are an important step to try to reduce that risk. Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre on the island of Borneo is one of many sanctuaries for great apes that has closed its doors to the public. Susan Sheward, founder and chairwoman of Orangutan Appeal UK, said in a statement: This disease could be fatal for the already critically endangered orangutan, it is a risk that we cannot afford take. OAUK will do everything it can to make sure that the orangutans at Sepilok stay healthy and safe. There are four types of great apes alive today: gorillas (Africa), bonobos (Africa), orangutans (SE Asia), and chimpanzees (Africa). Humans are closely related to great apes, sharing a common ancestor several million years ago."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52155008,Whale sharks: Atomic tests solve age puzzle of world's largest fish,"Data from atomic bomb tests conducted during the Cold War have helped scientists accurately age the world's biggest fish. Whale sharks are large, slow moving and docile creatures that mainly inhabit tropical waters. They are long-lived but scientists have struggled to work out the exact ages of these endangered creatures. But using the world's radioactive legacy they now have a workable method that can help the species survival. Whale sharks are both the biggest fish and the biggest sharks in existence. Growing up to 18m in length, and weighing on average of about 20 tonnes, their distinctive white spotted colouration makes them easily recognisable. These filter feeders live on plankton and travel long distances to find food. They are very popular with tourists in many locations, often allowing divers to swim alongside them. However, the species is now classified as endangered because of over-fishing in places like Thailand and the Philippines. Much about the species remains a mystery, especially how to age them correctly. Researchers say this is fundamental to understanding their growth rates - information that's considered crucial to saving the species in the long term. To date, scientists have tried to count distinct lines in the vertebrae of dead whale sharks. These act like rings in a tree trunk, increasing as the animal gets older. But scientists have been unsure about how often these rings can form and the reasons behind them. Now researchers say they have come up with a much more accurate way of determining the whale sharks' true age. From the late 1940s, several nations including the US, the Soviet Union, Great Britain, France and China conducted atomic bomb tests in different locations. One side effect of all these explosions was the doubling of an atom type, or isotope, called Carbon-14 in the atmosphere. Over time, every living thing on the planet has absorbed this extra Carbon-14 which still persists. But as scientists know the rate at which this isotope decays, it is a very useful marker in determining age. The older the creature, the less Carbon-14 you'd expect to find. So any animal that was alive then incorporated that spike in Carbon-14 into their hard parts, said author Dr Mark Meekan, from the Australian Institute of Marine Science in Perth. That means we've got a time marker within the vertebrae that means we can work out the periodicity at which those isotopes decay. One of the difficulties with ageing these sharks has been in getting access to samples of vertebrae. This team managed to find two long-dead specimens stored in Pakistan and Taiwan. The study indicated that these creatures do actually live an incredibly long time. The absolute longevity of these animals could be very, very old, possibly as much as 100-150 years old, said Dr Meekan. This has huge implications for the species. It suggests that these things are probably intensely vulnerable to over-harvesting. The scientists say their results explain why whale shark numbers have collapsed in locations like Thailand and Taiwan where fishing has taken place. They are just not built for humans to exploit, said Dr Meekan. While the species has recently been upgraded from threatened to endangered on the IUCN Red List, the scientists believe that their work will help efforts at conservation. By being able to accurately estimate the age of whale sharks, the scientists will be able to provide more accurate guidance on how well a population is doing and whether any fishing can be allowed. In many tropical regions, whale shark tourism is now a major attraction. The researchers say that encouraging co-operation between different countries along the vast routes that whale sharks follow is key to their survival. Whale sharks are a fantastic ambassador for marine life and one that has lifted so many people out of poverty, added Dr Meekan. This is a good news story - and it shows there is a silver lining to the mushroom cloud after all, he quipped. The study has been published in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-52228423,Why does President Trump want to mine on the Moon?,"President Trump wants the United States to start mining on the Moon for minerals. The US president recently signed an executive order stating America has the right to explore and use resources from outer space. The order also said the US did not see space as a common area for resources, and didn't need permission of international agreements to get started. But why does he want to mine in space? And what are the benefits? Radio 1 Newsbeat has been speaking to a couple of experts who can fill us in. According to Sarah Cruddas, mining the Moon will help humans travel further in space, to places like Mars. Sarah's a space journalist and says the Moon can become an intergalactic petrol station - because it has the resources needed for rocket fuel - like hydrogen and oxygen. Having a petrol station in space means rockets can travel further into space before worrying about running out of fuel. It's like not taking a kitchen sink when you go on holiday. We shouldn't need to take everything with us when we go into space, Sarah tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. Exploring deeper is important because space has lots of resources which can be used to benefit our planet. Professor Benjamin Sovacool says the world is moving towards renewable energy sources because of climate change and needs those resources. We are currently depleting the resources we have, Benjamin tells Newsbeat. Benjamin is professor of energy policy at University of Sussex and says mining more materials in space can help build items such as electric cars - which will be good for the environment in the long-term. Metals such as lithium or cobalt - which you need - are mainly in places like China, Russia or Congo. And it's difficult to get them. He says it can be complicated trying to source materials from different suppliers around the world, all of which have different rules. Mining on the Moon, with one entity, might be easier, he adds. Sarah says mining those materials on Earth in places like Congo, is done in horrible conditions. But Benjamin does warn that in space mining doesn't offer a short-term fix for climate change on earth. One of the reasons behind President Trump's decision to mine on the Moon could be a lack of access to minerals for the US compared with other parts of the world. The US has lost the race - other countries are ahead, like China and Russia, says Benjamin. Materials mined by China have been made available around the world. It will be really attractive to people like President Trump if you are able to get minerals in a place where the Chinese aren't - like space. There has been tension between the US and China since President Trump came to power, and Benjamin says this is a chance for him to assert dominance and leadership. President Trump's order is clear that international law won't apply to US efforts in space - but laws about what humans can do off-planet are less well defined. Space law is developing, it's something that will change over time, Sarah says. No country can claim to own the Moon, but currently it's like maritime law: If you go there, find it and mine it - it's yours to keep. Benjamin says setting our sights on outer space may be inevitable because of climate change happening here on our planet. One of the arguments people make is space is the only place left to go because we'll eventually mess up our Earth so much, he says. That viewpoint demands space exploration as the only viable alternative for the future of humanity. According to Sarah, the technology is there and progress is fast because there are more private companies involved. Before, it was always government funded. But with private companies and individuals, there's more money and ambition, she tells Newsbeat. We're going to see huge advances on things like mining on the Moon, mining asteroids and the sea, and humans visiting Mars. That's all feasible within our lifetime. But Benjamin says it's also important to use technological developments on existing mining processes on Earth. Lunar mining is at the top of the pyramid, it's really hard to reach, he says. So first develop existing mines, such as gas and deep-water mining. After that, you can go to the next level up. He feels lunar mining is at least 10 to 15 years away, and its future will even then be very dependent on other factors such as money and resource. Ultimately, though, Sarah says it's all a part of something greater. You look up at the Moon, we're watching the sky. It's all part of being involved in extending humanity beyond Earth.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52062158,Plastic: How to predict threats to animals in oceans and rivers,"Hosepipes inside a sperm whale, plastic banana bags eaten by green turtles and a shotgun cartridge inside a True's beaked whale. Just some of the examples of plastic found inside wildlife that have been documented in scientific reports. Researchers went through records of plastic eaten by aquatic creatures to find out more about the risks. They say the length of an animal can be used to estimate how big a piece of plastic it might accidentally consume. This amounts to about a 20th of the size of the animal. They hope the data can be used to find out more about the risks. More than 700 species of marine and freshwater animals are known to ingest plastic, but study researcher Dr Ifan Jâms of Cardiff University said it was difficult to figure out how much plastic they could be eating. This information gives us a way to start measuring the extent of the plastic pollution problem, he said. We hope this study lays a foundation for including the 'ingestibility' of plastics into global risk assessments. Dr Jâms and colleagues at Cardiff trawled through published data to examine records of plastic found inside more than 2,000 marine and freshwater species, including mammals, reptiles, fish and invertebrates, from tiny fish larvae to 10-metre-long whales. They created an equation to predict the maximum size of plastic item an animal can swallow, based on the length of its body. The new equation could help determine the risk of plastics to any species - and the amount of plastic that may be moving into oceans and rivers, and entering food chains. Project leader Prof Isabelle Durance said: All of us will have seen distressing, often heart-breaking, images of animals affected by plastic, but a great many more interactions between animals and plastic are never witnessed. This study gives us a new way of visualising those many, many unseen events. The research is published in Nature Communications. Follow Helen on Twitter."

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52231899,Cities struggling to boost urban tree cover,"Many cities around the globe are struggling to reconcile ambitious environmental targets with development pressures, a study has suggested. Scientists in Melbourne recorded a net gain in street tree cover but a net loss in parks and private land. The Australian team says measures to protect mature trees are critical if the urban forest's cover is to be enhanced in the future. The findings appear in the Sustainable Cities and Society journal. Globally, the role of trees in towns and cities are well recognised, such as providing shade during hot summer months, and helping to absorb noise pollution and floodwater. The team of researchers in Australia examined the plight of trees in the city of Melbourne in the decade between 2008 and 2017. They observed a complex pattern: Our analyses showed a net gain in tree canopy cover in public streets and a net loss of canopy cover in public parks and private properties, they say in their study. The team said the most frequently removed trees from public parks and streets were small ones, with trunk diameters less than 15cm. They identified that trees near to developments were among the most at-risk trees. Almost 2,000 street trees were removed within 10m of major development sites, equivalent to almost 20% of all street trees removed… but this only constituted only 8% of streetscape tree canopy cover losses, they wrote. Co-author Thami Croeser, a PhD student at the Centre for Urban Research at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, said they were able to record the size of trees removed in Melbourne. We found that most of them were quite young, he said. Only about one-in-20 was a mature tree thicker than 60cm [diameter]. He told BBC News: Overall, the tree canopy cover in the inner city stayed just ahead of losses to development. Our parks lost canopy, as did private properties, but canopy from street trees grew slightly on balance. He suggested this was a result of officials in Melbourne operating a strong tree protection policy - it can cost tens of thousands of Australian dollars to remove a large, mature tree. This seems to act as an effective disincentive. Melbourne city officials also operate a considerable planting programme, with about 3,000 new trees being put into the ground each year. This offsets the losses somewhat, observed Mr Croeser, although replacing a 20-year-old tree with a sapling definitely is not the same, the sheer volume of planting helps. Melbourne is well-known as a tree city. Officials had tagged every tree in the city and gave each one an individual email address. The scheme was set up so that people could report problems or concerns. Instead, people sent affectionate notes to the gums, oaks and elms. While some cities are supportive of trees, and the benefits they provide - such as mitigating the urban heat island effect, providing habitats for insects, animals and birds, and improving our sense of wellbeing - other cities have fallen foul of angry protesters and residents. Sheffield, in the UK, is considered to be one of the nation's greener cities. Yet the council undertook a widespread programme of street tree removals in 2017. The strategy of the council's Streets Ahead strategy - under which about 5,500 trees have been removed since 2012 and replaced with saplings - said that felling was only considered as a last resort. But residents and protesters said that trees that did not need to be felled were being cut down. Tensions and tempers rose. Protests were staged. People were arrested. The stand-off resulted in widespread media coverage. An investigation by the UK's local government ombudsman found that Sheffield council had misled residents. The council accepted the findings and issued apologies to the residents. Tree canopy cover in England's towns and cities is, on average, 16%. A citizen science project, Forest Research - in partnership with Tree for Cities and Brillianto - found that the cover in 283 urban conurbations ranged from 3% to 45%. Explaining the motivation for the UK-wide map of urban tree cover, Forest Research said: Urban trees are being increasingly recognised for the many benefits they provide, such removing carbon dioxide and pollutants from the air, providing habitats for wildlife, and making our urban areas more attractive, enjoyable and healthy places to be. As the issue of climate change forms a central pillar of government policies, many cities are setting targets to boost their urban tree canopy cover. In the last UK General election, the government - in its manifesto - pledged to plant an additional 75,000 acres of trees each year by the next Parliament - in other words, by 2024. In order to deliver this ambitious target, councils in urban areas would be expected to help deliver this goal. At the World Forum on Urban Trees, held in Italy during 2018, delegates issued a call for action to highlight the benefits of trees in cities. More than half of the world's population now live in urban areas, and this is forecast to grow to 68% by the middle of the 21st Century. While is it widely accepted that tree cover can improve people's daily wellbeing, Thami Croeser said the Melbourne study highlighted a few factors for tree officers around the globe. Many cities measure the number of trees they plant as their main target for urban forests, he told BBC News. That's not actually the real challenge; it a matter of planting them and keeping them alive and healthy. He said that tree canopy targets were a good idea because they focused on the cover that trees give us, rather than planting numbers."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51048366,Coronavirus symptoms: What are they and how do I protect myself?,"Coronavirus has claimed more than 106,000 lives and infected more than 1.7m people around the world. Among them is UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is recovering in hospital after being treated in intensive care for Covid-19. Coronavirus infects the lungs. The two main symptoms are a fever and a dry cough, which can sometimes lead to breathing problems. The cough to look out for is a new, continuous cough. This means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or having three or more coughing episodes in 24 hours. If you usually have a cough, it may be worse than usual. You have a fever if your temperature is above 37.8C. This can make you feel warm, cold or shivery. A sore throat, headache and diarrhoea have also been reported and a loss of smell and taste may also be a symptom. It takes five days on average to start showing the symptoms, but some people will get them much later. The World Health Organization (WHO) says the incubation period lasts up to 14 days. The majority of people with coronavirus will recover after rest and pain relief (such as paracetamol). The main reason people need hospital treatment is difficulty breathing. Doctors may scan the lungs to see how badly they are affected and give support, such as oxygen or ventilation, if needed. However, people should not go to A&E if they are concerned. In the UK, the NHS 111 website will guide you through what to do. If you are so breathless that you are unable to speak more than a few words you will be told to call 999, as this is a medical emergency. If you become so ill that you've stopped doing all of your usual daily activities then it will advise speaking to a nurse by dialling NHS 111. Intensive care units (ICUs) are specialist wards for people who are very ill. Coronavirus patients will get oxygen support, which can involve using a facemask, or a tube in the nose. The most invasive way - for the most seriously ill patients - is ventilation where air, with increased levels of oxygen, is pushed into the lungs via a tube in the mouth, nose or through a small cut in the throat. Patients with mild symptoms should self-isolate at home for at least seven days. People are advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried. They should also not go to their GP, or A&E. Details for Scotland are to check NHS inform, then ring your GP in office hours, or 111 out-of-hours. In Wales call NHS 111, and in Northern Ireland, call your GP. If you have come into contact with somebody who may be infected, you may be told to self-isolate. The World Health Organization has also issued advice for the public. The proportion dying from the disease appears low (between 1% and 2%) - but the figures are unreliable. Thousands are being treated but may go on to die - so the death rate could be higher. But it may also be lower if lots of mild cases are unreported. A World Health Organization (WHO) examination of data from 56,000 patients suggests: Older people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure), are more likely to become severely ill. Men are at slightly higher risk of dying from the virus than women. Work to develop a vaccine is under way. The best thing is regular and thorough hand washing, preferably with soap and water. Coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can be breathed in, or cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on, then your eyes, nose or mouth. So, coughing and sneezing into tissues, not touching your face with unwashed hands, and avoiding close contact with infected people are important. People will be most infectious when they have symptoms, but some may spread the virus even before they are sick. Face masks do not provide effective protection, according to medical experts. However, the WHO is re-examining whether the public might benefit from using them. Follow James on Twitter.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52269426,Coronavirus: Gown supply 'critically low' in some hospitals,"An NHS boss has warned the number of protective gowns available to front-line staff in parts of the country has become critically low in recent days. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers in England, has called for a more sustainable supply of gowns, which are imported from China. On Sunday, the health secretary said the amount of available PPE - personal protective equipment - was increasing. It came as deaths in UK hospitals rose to 11,329 - up by 717 since Sunday. The Department of Health said a further 4,342 people had tested positive for coronavirus as of 09:00 BST on Monday. Meanwhile, a review of the UK's lockdown measures will take place later this week. Mr Hopson, from NHS Providers in England which represents hospital trusts, told BBC Breakfast that the number of protective gowns available to NHS staff in some parts of the country was very, very low. Mr Hopson said that the NHS ordered a whole load of stock weeks ago, but delays have been caused by the gowns sometimes failing safety tests, while other batches have been mislabelled - meaning the NHS has ended up with additional masks. He added: If everything had been flowing exactly as had been ordered and if all of the material had properly passed its safety test, there would not be an issue. This is all really hand-to-mouth in terms of gown delivery, and we need to get to a more sustainable supply. At the government's daily briefing on Sunday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government was working night and day to make sure we get the right PPE. I'm glad to say there are now record amounts [of PPE] in the system, he said, adding: Daily we're delivering millions of items to the frontline. On gowns, he said: In the last two days 121,000 gowns have been delivered around the country and more are going out today and in the week to come. Mr Hopson said that the vast majority of preparations for the outbreak within the NHS had gone well, with nearly all stocks of PPE flowing in the way that trusts would like. The bit where there's a particular problem was gowns, he said. We know that over the last 72 hours some trusts have run critically low on gowns. No trust, as far as I'm aware, has actually run out but some of the stocks are very, very low. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has confirmed public services will receive more than £14bn from the government's coronavirus emergency response fund, including more than £6bn for health services. The Treasury said the funding would go towards freeing up hospital beds and delivering urgent priorities such as acquiring ventilators, diagnostic tests and protective equipment for NHS staff. A gown is a piece of PPE used to protect the body of those who might come into contact with coronavirus. It should be made of water-resistant material and have long sleeves. If the gown is not water resistant, a waterproof apron is needed underneath to protect the wearer from droplets containing the virus. The World Health Organization says gowns should be worn by all doctors, nurses and cleaners who enter coronavirus patients' rooms in hospitals. They should also be used by those handling coronavirus samples in labs and healthcare workers, cleaners and ambulance crews in places where patients with suspected coronavirus symptoms are seen. Public Health England guidance says hospital staff can sometimes use gowns for a whole session, such as a ward round or when caring for several patients in ICU. Otherwise, a single use is recommended. It comes as Downing Street denied that cabinet minister Michael Gove's daughter being tested for coronavirus was an example of double standards. Tests are not yet available for most people and mainly reserved for seriously ill patients in hospital. The prime minister's spokesman said the test was carried out on the advice of the chief medical officer and in line with medical guidance. The spokesman said Mr Gove's job is a central role in the government's response and the test meant he could get back to work. Latest government figures show 18,000 tests were carried out on Saturday. There are 23 drive-through testing sites now open for NHS staff, No 10 said. Meanwhile, No 10 has said Mr Johnson will recover at Chequers - the PM's official country residence - as it was considered to be a suitable place. The spokesman added Mr Johnson will not be carrying out government work. Mr Raab is currently in charge of running the government. On Sunday, Mr Johnson thanked NHS staff after being discharged from hospital in London, where he was being treated for Covid-19 - the disease caused by the coronavirus. It is unclear whether the prime minister will take part in the lockdown review, which is due to be carried out by Thursday. Wales' health minister said last week that the lockdown would remain for several more weeks at the very least. And Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned there was no likelihood or prospect of measures being lifted after the Easter weekend. NHS England said on Monday that a further 667 patients with coronavirus had died in the country, while a further 15 deaths were recorded in Wales, and a further nine in Scotland. Recently widowed Hannah - not her real name - has told how her husband of more than 40 years died after contracting coronavirus. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that her husband was in hospital for about a week before he died, and was put on a CPAP machine, which delivers oxygen to the lungs without needing a ventilator, to aid his breathing during that time. Describing his death, she said his breathing was really laboured. It is not a nice, quiet way to go, she said. Hannah added: This is such a cruel disease. Apart from the medical staff that he saw when he had to, [my husband] was alone for a week. Wendy's father fell ill with coronavirus around a month ago and he has now been taken off a ventilator in hospital. They've given him medication to keep him calm and relaxed and it is a matter of just waiting now for him to fade away peacefully, she told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire. The nurses are with him, they are holding his hand, they've been absolutely marvellous, Wendy added. We had to make the decision for the ventilator to be removed and for him to pass away peacefully. Sam Monaghan, the head of the UK's largest charity care provider MHA, told BBC Breakfast that about 150 of its residents had died with confirmed or suspected coronavirus, as well as two staff members. It comes as 12 residents of a County Durham care home have now died after displaying symptoms of coronavirus. In other developments: Have you been affected by the coronavirus?

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51214864,Coronavirus: What it does to the body,"The coronavirus emerged in only December last year, but already the world is dealing with a pandemic of the virus and the disease it causes - Covid-19. For most, the disease is mild, but some people die. So how is the virus attacking the body, why are some people being killed and how is it treated? This is when the virus is establishing itself. Viruses work by getting inside the cells your body is made of and then hijacking them. The coronavirus, officially called Sars-CoV-2, can invade your body when you breathe it in (after someone coughs nearby) or you touch a contaminated surface and then your face. It first infects the cells lining your throat, airways and lungs and turns them into coronavirus factories that spew out huge numbers of new viruses that go on to infect yet more cells. At this early stage, you will not be sick and some people may never develop symptoms. The incubation period, the time between infection and first symptoms appearing, varies widely, but is five days on average. This is all most people will experience. Covid-19 is a mild infection for eight out of 10 people who get it and the core symptoms are a fever and a cough. Body aches, sore throat and a headache are all possible, but not guaranteed. The fever, and generally feeling grotty, is a result of your immune system responding to the infection. It has recognised the virus as a hostile invader and signals to the rest of the body something is wrong by releasing chemicals called cytokines. These rally the immune system, but also cause the body aches, pain and fever. The coronavirus cough is initially a dry one (you're not bringing stuff up) and this is probably down to irritation of cells as they become infected by the virus. Some people will eventually start coughing up sputum - a thick mucus containing dead lung cells killed by the virus. These symptoms are treated with bed rest, plenty of fluids and paracetamol. You won't need specialist hospital care. This stage lasts about a week - at which point most recover because their immune system has fought off the virus. However, some will develop a more serious form of Covid-19. This is the best we understand at the moment about this stage, however, there are studies emerging that suggest the disease can cause more cold-like symptoms such as a runny nose too. If the disease progresses it will be due to the immune system overreacting to the virus. Those chemical signals to the rest of the body cause inflammation, but this needs to be delicately balanced. Too much inflammation can cause collateral damage throughout the body. The virus is triggering an imbalance in the immune response, there's too much inflammation, how it is doing this we don't know, said Dr Nathalie MacDermott, from King's College London. Inflammation of the lungs is called pneumonia. If it was possible to travel through your mouth down the windpipe and through the tiny tubes in your lungs, you'd eventually end up in tiny little air sacs. This is where oxygen moves into the blood and carbon dioxide moves out, but in pneumonia the tiny sacs start to fill with water and can eventually cause shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. Some people will need a ventilator to help them breathe. This stage is thought to affect around 14% of people, based on data from China. It is estimated around 6% of cases become critically ill. By this point the body is starting to fail and there is a real chance of death. The problem is the immune system is now spiralling out of control and causing damage throughout the body. It can lead to septic shock when the blood pressure drops to dangerously low levels and organs stop working properly or fail completely. Acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by widespread inflammation in the lungs stops the body getting enough oxygen it needs to survive. It can stop the kidneys from cleaning the blood and damage the lining of your intestines. The virus sets up such a huge degree of inflammation that you succumb... it becomes multi-organ failure, Dr Bharat Pankhania said. And if the immune system cannot get on top of the virus, then it will eventually spread to every corner of the body where it can cause even more damage. Treatment by this stage will be highly invasive and can include ECMO or extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation. This is essentially an artificial lung that takes blood out of the body through thick tubes, oxygenates it and pumps it back in. But eventually the damage can reach fatal levels at which organs can no longer keep the body alive. Doctors have described how some patients died despite their best efforts. The first two patients to die at Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, China, detailed in the Lancet Medical journal, were seemingly healthy, although they were long-term smokers and that would have weakened their lungs. The first, a 61-year-old man, had severe pneumonia by the time he arrived at hospital. He was in acute respiratory distress, and despite being put on a ventilator, his lungs failed and his heart stopped beating. He died 11 days after he was admitted. The second patient, a 69-year-old man, also had acute respiratory distress syndrome. He was attached to an ECMO machine but this wasn't enough. He died of severe pneumonia and septic shock when his blood pressure collapsed. Follow James on Twitter."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52261859,Coronavirus: UK could be 'worst affected' country in Europe,"The UK is likely to be among the European countries worst affected by coronavirus, one of the government's senior scientific advisers has said. The warning from Sir Jeremy Farrar comes as UK hospital deaths are set to pass 10,000 on Sunday. In response, Business Secretary Alok Sharma said countries were on different trajectories. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been discharged from hospital after being treated for coronavirus. On the advice of his medical team, Mr Johnson will not immediately return to work and will continue his recovery at his country residence, Chequers, a No 10 spokesman said. He had three nights in intensive care before returning to a general ward on Thursday. The total number of coronavirus hospital deaths in the UK currently stands at 9,875, following a rise of 917 recorded on Saturday. The figure does not include deaths outside of hospitals, such as in care homes or in the community. On Sunday, a further 657 deaths were announced in England, 24 in Scotland, 18 in Wales and 11 in Northern Ireland. The latest UK-wide figures have not yet been confirmed by the Department of Health. Ministers are continuing to urge people to stay at home over the Easter weekend to curb the spread of the virus, despite warm and sunny weather across parts of the UK. Wellcome Trust director Sir Jeremy Farrar told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show the UK was likely to be one of the worst, if not the worst affected country in Europe. Currently Italy has the highest number of deaths of any European country - with more than 19,000 deaths - followed by Spain, France and the UK, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Germany has kept deaths below 3,000 so far. Sir Jeremy, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show the remarkable scale of testing in Germany had been key to keeping the number of hospital admissions for coronavirus lower than in the UK. Sir Jeremy said testing allowed countries to isolate people with Covid-19, preventing them from transmitting the virus to others, as well as buying time for hospitals to prepare. Undoubtedly there are lessons to learn from that, he added. The UK government has said it wants to do 100,000 coronavirus tests a day by the end of April but has faced criticism for not increasing the number more quickly. Sir Jeremy said a second or third wave of the virus was probably inevitable and treatment and a vaccine was our only true exit strategy. He said a vaccine could be available by autumn but it would take longer to ramp up manufacturing to the scale required to vaccinate many millions of people. I would hope we would get [that] done in 12 months but that is in itself an unprecedented ambition, he said. Asked whether he agreed with Sir Jeremy's analysis of the UK's death rate, Business Secretary Alok Sharma said: Different countries are at different stages of this cycle. What we have done with the advice that we have now set out to people, to stay at home, is precisely because we want to make sure that we have a flattening of the curve, that infection rates aren't going up, and ultimately people's lives are being saved, he told the programme. We are starting to see these measures work, he added, but said it was too early for them to be lifted yet. Prof Keith Neal, emeritus professor in the epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, said it was likely the UK would have one of the largest numbers of coronavirus deaths because it had the second largest population in western Europe after Germany. The important figure is the death rate per million and not the total number of deaths. On this count Belgium seems to be heading for a serious problem like Italy and Spain, he said. There have been so many grim milestones in this coronavirus outbreak but passing a death toll of 10,000 may prove one of the most shocking. There are positive signs that the rate of infection is slowing, driven down by social distancing. But the numbers dying every day may increase still further because some people who caught the virus three or four weeks ago may not survive intensive care now. The scientists advising the government have long warned of this lag between measures to keep the public at home and a reduction in the daily death toll. The expectation is that on current trends there will be a peak, perhaps in a week or two, though no-one can predict how long it'll take after that for the losses to fall to low levels. It all depends on the public's response and so far officials say it's been overwhelmingly supportive.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52264145,"Coronavirus: 'Sombre day' as UK deaths hit 10,000","The UK has recorded 737 new coronavirus-related hospital deaths, taking the total number to 10,612. It comes after one of the government's senior scientific advisers said the UK was likely to be among the worst-affected European countries. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said today marks a sombre day, but welcomed the efforts people had made to stay at home. The number of reported deaths does not include deaths outside of hospitals. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson thanked healthcare workers for saving his life after being discharged from hospital. Mr Hancock told the daily press briefing: Today marks a sombre day in the impact of this disease as we join the list of countries who have seen more than 10,000 deaths related to coronavirus. The fact that over 10,000 people have now lost their lives to this invisible killer demonstrates just how serious this coronavirus is and why the national effort that everyone is engaged in is so important. The UK is the fifth country to surpass 10,000 deaths, joining the US, Spain, Italy and France. Earlier, Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the UK was likely to be one of the worst, if not the worst affected country in Europe. In comparison, he said, the remarkable scale of testing in Germany had been key to keeping the number of hospital admissions for coronavirus lower than in the UK. Undoubtedly there are lessons to learn from that, he said. Responding to Sir Jeremy's comments, the health secretary said: The future of this virus is unknowable as yet because it depends on the behaviour of millions of people and the great British public. Mr Hancock added that the government took advice from experts very seriously. Public Health England medical director Professor Yvonne Doyle said the number of people in hospital with coronavirus in London was stabilising, but it was increasing in north-west England, Yorkshire and north-east England. Speaking about the loved ones of those who had died, Mr Hancock said: Their grief is our grief and their stories will not be forgotten. Janice Graham, 58, was the first NHS worker in Scotland to die from coronavirus. Her son said he would miss everything about her. The health secretary also congratulated the British public for rising to this challenge of staying at home. Your steadfast commitment to following these social distancing rules is making a difference, he added. Ministers are continuing to urge people to stay at home over the Easter weekend to curb the spread of the virus, despite warm and sunny weather across parts of the UK. Today's fall in the number of newly announced deaths of people with coronavirus is of little comfort as we pass the tragic milestone of 10,000. And we know that the true death toll to date is higher: this figure doesn't include people who have died with coronavirus but whose death has not yet been reported to the Department for Health. But it could have been worse. Up until last weekend, this figure was doubling every three and a half days. Had that continued, we might have seen more than 2,500 deaths announced today. That growth has not happened. Today's fall could be attributed to less reporting of deaths over a bank holiday. Even if we have not turned the corner, the number of deaths announced each day has held below 1,000 throughout the week. That is still a terrifying figure. But the slowdown in the growth of new cases, of people hospitalised with coronavirus and in deaths all add to the evidence that the lockdown is working. The health secretary also announced plans for an NHS app that will warn users if they have recently been in close proximity to someone suspected of having been infected by the coronavirus. Mr Hancock also addressed ongoing criticism over the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) for NHS staff. He denied that the government had been too slow to stockpile PPE and said supplies had been significant, but acknowledged there was always more to be done. There were now record amounts in the system, he added. Mr Hancock said there was more spare capacity for critical care than there was when coronavirus first hit our shores. As of Sunday, there were 2,295 spare critical care beds across Great Britain, up by 150 from Saturday, he said. In other developments:"
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52258980,Coronavirus: Boris Johnson 'owes his life to NHS staff',"Boris Johnson has said he owes his life to the NHS staff treating him for coronavirus. In a statement released by No 10, the prime minister, 55, thanked medics at St Thomas' Hospital in London, where he continues to recover after spending three nights in intensive care. It comes as UK deaths from the virus are expected to pass 10,000 on Sunday. On Saturday, the UK recorded 917 new coronavirus deaths, taking total hospital deaths to 9,875. Ministers are continuing to urge people to stay at home over the Easter weekend to curb the spread of the virus, despite warm and sunny weather across parts of the UK. Meanwhile, Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust - Britain's biggest charitable funder of scientific research - said the UK was likely to be one of the worst, if not the worst affected country in Europe. Sir Jeremy, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), also told BBC' One's Andrew Marr programme that a second or third wave of the virus was probably inevitable and treatment and a vaccine was our only true exit strategy. He said a vaccine could be available by autumn but it would take longer to ramp up manufacturing to the scale required to vaccinate many millions of people. I would hope we would get [that] done in 12 months but that is in itself an unprecedented ambition, he said. Asked whether he agreed with Sir Jeremy's analysis of the UK's death rate, Business Secretary Alok Sharma said: Different countries are at different stages of this cycle. What we have done with the advice that we have now set out to people, to stay at home, is precisely because we want to make sure that we have a flattening of the curve, that infection rates aren't going up, and ultimately people's lives are being saved, he told the programme. We are starting to see these measures work, he added, but said it was too early for them to be lifted yet. In his first public statement since being moved out of intensive care on Thursday, Mr Johnson paid tribute to the medics treating him, saying: I can't thank them enough. I owe them my life. Speaking as she led the government's daily coronavirus briefing on Saturday, Home Secretary Priti Patel said the PM needed time and space to rest, recuperate and recover. BBC political correspondent Ben Wright said No 10 did not want to speculate about when the PM might leave hospital or be back at his desk, but a return to work does not look imminent. He said the prime minister was expected to rest and recover in the coming weeks, with Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab continuing to deputise - and to be in charge when ministers carry out a review of the lockdown measures. Meanwhile, a message posted from the prime minister's Twitter account wished the country a happy Easter, as worshippers marked the festival from home. This year across the country churches will remain closed and families will spend the day apart, the message said. But by staying home, remember, you are protecting the NHS and saving lives. The number of new deaths announced on Saturday was slightly down on the previous day's 980 deaths - but was the second day in a row the figure had been more than 900. Abdul Mabud Chowdhury, 53, was a married father-of-two and a consultant urologist. He died with coronavirus on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Parliament is to return virtually on 21 April to debate coronavirus measures, authorise spending and make laws. It comes after Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said MPs must be able to hold the government's decisions to account. There've been so many grim milestones in this coronavirus outbreak but passing a death toll of 10,000 may prove one of the most shocking. There are positive signs that the rate of infection is slowing, driven down by social distancing. But the numbers dying every day may increase still further because some people who caught the virus three or four weeks ago may not survive intensive care now. The scientists advising the government have long warned of this lag between measures to keep the public at home and a reduction in the daily death toll. The expectation is that on current trends there will be a peak, perhaps in a week or two, though no-one can predict how long it'll take after that for the losses to fall to low levels. It all depends on the public's response and so far officials say it's been overwhelmingly supportive. In other developments:"
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52252470,Coronavirus: Priti Patel 'sorry if people feel there have been failings' on PPE,"The home secretary has said she is sorry if NHS staff feel there has been a failure to provide protective kit for those treating coronavirus patients. But Priti Patel said there were going to be problems during what she called an unprecedented global pandemic. The British Medical Association earlier said that NHS staff were putting their lives at risk when treating patients. The health secretary said earlier that 19 NHS workers had died with coronavirus since the outbreak began. Speaking at Saturday's coronavirus briefing in Downing Street, the home secretary said: I'm sorry if people feel that there have been failings. I will be very, very clear about that. But at the same time, we are in an unprecedented global health pandemic right now. It is inevitable that the demand and the pressures on PPE and demand for PPE are going to be exponential. On Friday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there was enough kit for everyone and unveiled a plan to address shortages. He said the government was looking into how NHS staff who had died with the virus had been infected - adding that some may have caught it outside of work. But that doesn't take away from the bravery of every single NHS worker, he said, adding that his heart goes out to those who have died and their families. Mr Hancock said he was particularly struck at the high proportion of people from minority ethnic backgrounds and people who have come to this country to work in the NHS who have died of coranavirus. We should recognise their enormous contribution, he added. Supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) in London and Yorkshire are at dangerously low levels, according to the BMA. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, BMA council chair, said doctors were being forced into a corner and faced heart-breaking decisions over whether to carry on without proper protection. He said: This is an immensely difficult position to be in, but is ultimately down to the government's chronic failure to supply us with the proper equipment. A nurse at Watford General Hospital in Hertfordshire, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the BBC he felt unsafe with the level of PPE he had been given. He said shortages meant those working on wards with coronavirus patients were only being given a surgical mask and plastic apron, rather than a gown covering the whole body. Last week a nursing assistant who had been looking after coronavirus patients at the hospital died. We are scared because we are spreading the virus, he said. We don't deserve it and our patients even more. The health secretary said 742 million pieces of protective gear had been delivered so far, saying: There's enough PPE to go around, but only if it's used in line with our guidance. We need everyone to treat PPE like the precious resource that it is. Mr Hancock said he was not impugning anyone who works for the NHS and they do an amazing job. But what I am reiterating, stressing, is the importance to use the right amount of PPE, he added. However, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was insulting to imply frontline staff are wasting PPE and the government must act to ensure sufficient supplies are delivered. For several weeks, the government and NHS leaders have insisted there are enough stocks of personal protective equipment (PPE) and that the problem lay in the distribution from warehouses to the front line. Some hospitals have reported receiving higher consignments of gloves, masks, gowns and aprons. But doctors and nurses have continued to report shortages. Care homes, pharmacies, GP practices and community health teams feel they are at the back of the queue for equipment to protect staff who may come into contact with patients who have Covid-19. There has also been confusion over how safety guidelines should apply. Now Matt Hancock has admitted there are global supply problems and says it is a herculean effort to get deliveries to health workers and a huge task to keep it going. He set out a series of measures to step up provision of equipment. He may be given credit for acknowledging the scale of the problem. But NHS and care staff won't take much notice of plans until they are reflected in reality on the ground. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has dismissed any suggestion that healthcare staff have been overusing PPE. RCN chief executive Dame Donna Kinnair told the BBC no PPE was more precious a resource than a healthcare worker's life, a nurse's life, a doctor's life. I take offence, actually, that we are saying that healthcare workers are abusing or overusing PPE, she told BBC Breakfast, adding that nurses were still telling her they did not have adequate supply of protective equipment. Meanwhile, the business organisation Make It British said the government had not yet taken up offers from some firms to help manufacture PPE. The group said at least 100 companies had responded to an appeal for help four weeks ago but had heard nothing since. How have you been affected by the issues relating to coronavirus?

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52205655,Coronavirus: Body-bag stocks 'in danger of running out',"Mortuary suppliers have told BBC News they have no stocks of standard body bags left for sale, blaming the shortage on stockpiling due to the coronavirus pandemic. New stocks from overseas cannot be sourced for many weeks, they say. The NHS says it currently has adequate stocks but health workers report having to wrap bodies in sheets. Public Health England said the virus that caused Covid-19 degraded quickly after a patient had died. And there was no specific need for body bags to be used to transport these corpses, although there may be other practical reasons for their use. Barber Medical, which has the NHS contract for mortuary supplies, said availability of zipped mortuary bags was a real problem and they could not be sourced anywhere. The company has, however, increased the availability of polythene bags, known as body pouch bags, and urged any hospital or trust struggling with supplies to contact it. A major supplier to undertakers also told BBC News it could not get hold of body bags, because of stockpiling. NHS trusts and funeral directors were desperate for the bags and horrified by the official advice it was safe not to use them, it said. The bags it sells are made in China but it said it took six weeks to ship them to the UK and air freighting them was prohibitively expensive. The company has looked into making its own bags but cannot source the required plastic fibre. The supplier also said it was unable to keep up with the desperate demand from funeral directors for personal protective equipment (PPE) and the whole industry was worried about how to cope with current death rates. William Quail, managing director of mortuary supplies firm Mortuary Equipment Direct, has hired a team of people to sew between 150 and 200 body bags a day, but he said he was struggling to get the products to hospitals due to bureaucracy. He said at £57.50 the bags were more expensive than those made in China, which he said cost £9. Dignity is the word, Mr Quail said. I don't think £57 would seem very much if it was your mother or father. I understand they are more expensive but what is a body worth to treat it with respect. On Monday, Sally Goodright, a nurse in a west London hospital, wrote on Facebook, in a post later removed: We ran out of body bags but still the dead were arriving from the wards. The GMB union says some porters have been told to transport the bodies of patients in sheets. Helen O'Connor, a regional organiser at Epsom and St Helier NHS Trust, said: We are extremely concerned about the psychological and physical wellbeing of our hospital members who are traumatised and struggling to cope with the impact of this pandemic. They are on the front line, doing the type of work that would distress anyone and increasingly dealing with death. A spokeswoman for the trust denied there was a shortage - but did not dispute sheets were being used to wrap bodies, saying there were plenty of zippered body bags to get the hospital trust through the current period but under Public Health England guidance they were not always necessary. The guidance says: Body bags are not deemed necessary but may be used for other practical reasons. Placing a cloth or mask over the mouth of the deceased when moving them can help to prevent the release of aerosols. BBC News also received a report from a worker at Watford General Hospital who said bedsheets were being used to wrap the dead. When the West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust was asked if using bedsheets was appropriate, it responded: We're wrapping bodies in line with national procedures. BBC News understands an emergency stock of thousands of body bags held by emergency services will be made available to hospitals and funeral directors. An NHS Supply Chain spokeswoman said it had an adequate stock of body bags and was expecting more to arrive soon. Industry body the British Plastics Federation said UK plastics companies were stepping in to help provide equipment in high demand - but it had not received any requests for body bags."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52121376,Coronavirus: Will summer make a difference?,"The idea warmer weather might stop the coronavirus seems to have faded as the virus has spread around the globe. But could new research contain a glimmer of hope? It's too early to know for sure whether the new coronavirus is seasonal. To really know that, we'd have to watch how cases change in one place across the year. But we can look at its spread in different climates across the world for clues. There is some evidence coronavirus cases have particularly clustered around cooler, dryer regions. One study indicated countries particularly affected by the virus - those where it was spreading undetected via community transmission - by 10 March had lower average temperatures than those with fewer cases. Another paper looked at 100 Chinese cities with more than 40 cases of Covid-19 and suggested the higher the temperature and humidity, the lower the rate of transmission. And another, not yet peer-reviewed, study suggested that although cases of the new coronavirus could be found all over the world, outbreaks had particularly clustered in relatively cool and dry areas - at least until 23 March. But, as a group of researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine pointed out, the virus has now spread to every World Health Organization region, effectively spanning all climatic zones, from cold and dry to hot and humid regions. With lots of other viruses, including flu, a seasonal pattern is seen in the northern and southern hemispheres. But tropical regions close to the equator don't experience the same pattern. And some of the hot and humid regions that have seen locally transmitted cases of the Covid-19 virus, such as Malaysia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, are close to the equator and so might not provide the best evidence for what will happen elsewhere. But looking to the southern hemisphere, Australia and New Zealand - at the tail-end of their summer season when their first cases were seen - have had far fewer cases than many of their northern-hemisphere counterparts. There are lots of other factors at play, such as global footfall and the density of the population. And since the virus has gradually spread around the world - initially through global travel - at the same time as seasons have been changing, it's difficult to pinpoint the effect of climate specifically. There is some evidence other coronaviruses mainly circulate in the winter months, according to a team of researchers from University College London (UCL) and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. They asked almost 2,000 people for a weekly report on whether anyone in their household had symptoms of respiratory illness. And anyone with symptoms was asked to send in a swab for testing for a range of viruses. From this, the researchers observed large peaks in coronavirus cases in the winter, around the same time as flu season. There were a small number of cases in the summer. One of the study's authors, Ellen Fragaszy, at UCL said it was therefore possible we will see a bit of a relief in cases over the summer. But we could not be sure this is how the new coronavirus would behave. And the large number of cases and their spread across the world suggested we shouldn't be too hopeful of a summer respite. The new coronavirus, called Sars-Cov-2, which causes the Covid-19 disease, appears to spread in basically the same way as other coronaviruses. But what makes it distinct is the how ill it makes you and the number of deaths it causes. Dr Michael Head, at the University of Southampton, said the development and impact of the novel coronavirus was clearly very different from the existing 'common cold' type coronaviruses. It remains to be seen as to whether Covid-19 cases will decline in response to environmental changes such as temperature and humidity, he said. Follow Rachel on Twitter"
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52150861,Coronavirus: 'Local shortages' of intensive care drugs,"Some key medicines used in intensive care are in relatively short supply, the BBC has learned. Supply of anaesthetic medicines in some areas is a bit stretched, according to the Royal College of Anaesthetists. One consultant has told the BBC that supplies are running low and alternatives are already being used in intensive care in the Midlands. The government says it is aware there is an increase in demand for a number of intensive care drugs. On 2 April, four leading royal colleges and health organisations asked staff to act immediately and use alternatives to some first line medications in new guidance on changes to specific anaesthetic drugs facing pandemic pressures. Dr Ron Daniels, an intensive care consultant in the West Midlands, says his hospital is running low on propofol, a commonly used anaesthetic, and alfentanil, an opioid painkiller which is used in intensive care. We are also in short supply of noradrenaline, used to treat life-threateningly low blood pressure, and are now using these drugs only on people who really need them and using older drugs on people who need less intensive support. Dr Daniels says the quality of care for all intensive care patients, not just coronavirus sufferers, will likely be lower as a result as the crisis peaks, and believes there has been too much focus on ventilators. With the need of ventilation comes the need for medications to help circulation and blood pressure, he said. Without this medication, doctors have no choice but to try to find substitutes, said Dr Chaand Nagpaul, council chair of the British Medical Association. This may affect how long patients remain on ventilators, which are in short supply, as well as ultimately impacting their chances of recovery, he added. This needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. Dr Julia Patterson, founder of medical campaign group EveryDoctor, says she is aware of GPs and palliative care consultants who are also concerned about shortages of diamorphine, in addition to clinicians in ICUs. She says one ICU consultant in London, who is worried about stocks of muscle relaxants and anaesthetic drugs, has told her that the NHS is working to increase stocks but the situation is extremely concerning. The BBC has also been told the chief pharmaceutical officer of NHS England, Keith Ridge, has privately expressed concerns about the availability of some drugs. We are seeing some drugs being in relatively short supply, said Prof Mike Grocott, vice-president of the Royal College of Anaesthetists. He says in centres he has spoken to, some of the drugs supply is getting a bit stretched, and therefore we may choose to use different types of drugs, but he reassured patients that they would be safe. Relative shortages of different drugs - using alternative drugs in their place - is a very normal part of clinical practice, he said. We have a variety of different options that we can choose from a menu, if you like, under different circumstances. The British Generic Manufacturers Association - which represents UK-based manufacturers and suppliers of generic medicines - says supplies are being moved to areas experiencing shortages. Its director general, Warwick Smith, said it was seeing four or five times the amount of demand for medicines. He said one manufacturer recently requested the equivalent of three years' worth of supplies to ramp up production. In a statement, the Department of Health and Social Care said: We are aware there is an increase in demand for a number of intensive care drugs and we are working with the pharmaceutical industry to make additional supplies available. We are working closely with industry, the NHS and the relevant national expert groups to ensure precautions are in place to reduce the likelihood of shortages. Last week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was currently confident about the supply of drugs. NHS England has been approached for a response."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52183295,Coronavirus lockdown: How can we lift restrictions?,"When can I see my family? Have friends round? Have a night out? A holiday? Or even go back to work? When can children go back to school? Lockdowns have been essential for containing the spread of coronavirus, but they are causing huge disruption, and distress, to lives around the world. So when can they be lifted? There are big decisions for governments to make - when to act, which restrictions to lift, how to contain the virus instead and how to balance saving lives today with long-term damage to society. This is going to be a long journey - don't think it will all be over in a few weeks. Essentially we've got a lot of not very good options, it won't be one day and everything will change, but things could open up, Dr Adam Kucharski, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the BBC. We cannot simply return to normal after cases peak or even after they are reduced to very low levels. The best estimate of the proportion of people infected (and potentially immune) in the UK is just 4%. Or to put that another way - more than 63 million are still vulnerable to the infection. If we just lift the lockdown, then another explosive outbreak is inevitable. The fundamentals of the virus have not changed either - one person infected will, without a lockdown, pass it onto three others on average. Cutting those infections by 60-70% is what it takes to keep cases down. At the moment that means cutting our human contact by that amount. If we lift social distancing measures then something else has to come in to suppress the virus instead or at least to prevent people ending up in intensive care. There may be some easy wins if countries are already cutting infections by more than 70%. There is evidence that a lot of countries in lockdown have gone beyond that, in China it is 80-90%, said Dr Kucharski. A high number now is good for bringing cases down quickly. But it is also an opportunity to lift some of the current restrictions without leading to a spike in cases. China, particularly in the original epicentre of the pandemic - Wuhan, had a tough and lengthy lockdown that including shutting down public transport. It is not yet clear how much wiggle room other countries may or may not have. Massively increasing testing for the virus allows for a strategy called seek and destroy. You identify cases. Test anybody they came into contact with. And isolate them before they become infectious. It is remarkably similar to the approach taken at the start of the outbreak when there were relatively few imported cases being hunted down. Do this successfully enough and it will reduce the ability of the virus to spread and will mean we do not need as tough a set of restrictions on day-to-day life. At the moment you need, on average, a 60-70% reduction in social interactions to stop the outbreak increasing, said Dr Kucharski. If we can get that down to 30% that gives you a lot more to play with. But even massive testing is not life as normal. You would need other measures to keep the disease in check and these would have to be maintained in the long-term as the fundamentals (a virus that spreads and a vulnerable population) would not change. It is a more moderate version of where we are now, said Dr Kucharski. It is also intensive work that has to be done quickly in order to stay ahead of the infection (this is where talk of a smartphone app comes in to identify cases) and the method is most viable when cases are at low levels. Another strategy is called enhanced shielding. Instead of trying to suppress the coronavirus across every section of society you could instead aim to stop it completely for those most at risk. Age and other medical conditions greatly increase the risk of Covid-19 becoming fatal. The lockdown is preventing intensive care units being overwhelmed, but guaranteeing vulnerable groups don't get infected could achieve the same aim even if cases were spreading more widely in the young and the healthy. Prof Mark Woolhouse, from the University of Edinburgh, said: Very crudely, for 80% of us who are not vulnerable this is a nasty virus, it's certainly a significant health problem, but it wouldn't overwhelm the healthcare system and it wouldn't lock down society. If we really bolster that shielding, make a very strong shield indeed, then it buys you a lot more room and it may mean you can relax some measures permanently. We are already shielding the vulnerable and asking them to stay at home for 12 weeks. Enhancing that could mean all staff in hospitals, care homes or anyone visiting the elderly having regular testing to ensure they are clear of the virus. Ideally antibody tests would prove they are immune to it. The danger is having more virus circulating in the community could be harder to control and then those shields will come under intense pressure. Some restrictions have less of an effect on the virus than others. There are certain interactions and activities that are overall less risky, said Dr Kucharski. He argues lifting different restrictions can be put into three broad categories - those with low, moderate and substantial risk of increasing transmission of the virus. Low risk includes exercising outdoors, which has been restricted in some countries. Moderate would include letting some non-essential shops re-open or having occasional gatherings with people outside the household. Substantial increases could come from lifting advice to work from home, reopening schools or isolating sick people and quarantining households. I think the order things went in will be reflected in the order things will be lifted, he says. But which measures to lift will be a difficult balancing act. It will have to be a combination of the benefits to society and the economy against the impact on the spread of the virus. Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, said: We do want to find a collection of policies that maintain suppression of this virus. Without doubt, measures will be targeted probably by age, by geography and we will need to introduce in my view larger levels of testing at the community level to really isolate cases more effectively and identify where transmission is happening. The idea of immunity passports or certificates is constantly doing the rounds - if you've had the disease you have a test and if you have antibodies that can kill the virus then you can go about your daily life. However, there are a number of scientific challenges. We don't have an accurate antibody test. We don't know how long immunity might last. And we don't know that even if antibodies stop you from becoming ill whether they are enough to stop you harbouring the virus and spreading it to others. Prof Ferguson has suggested measures could begin to be lifted by the end of May. But there is also a decision about how far we go with suppressing the virus after we've gone past the peak. We could drive levels down as low as possible and that will greatly limit the ability of the virus to bounce back in a second wave. But the trade off is maintaining the lockdown for longer. Or we could exit lockdown earlier and accept having a higher number of cases bubbling away, which creates its own problems. There is also a decision over whether to maintain a UK-wide approach to lifting lockdown or whether measures could vary regionally, or even within cities, to focus on where outbreaks are happening. The biggest thing that could come along is a vaccine - if people were immunised then there would be no need for any social distancing measures. That is thought to be more than a year away. If a vaccine does not come along (people are hopeful, but it is requiring development at unprecedented speed) then the concept of herd immunity may kick in. This would happen when so many people had been infected (up to 70% of the population) that the virus can no longer cause large outbreaks. Effective drugs would also make a huge difference. If they could stop Covid-19 from progressing from a cough or fever into a serious disease needing intensive care then having large numbers of cases would be less of a problem. Again we are waiting for the results of clinical trials. We might get closer to normality, or at least normality for some, in the months to come. But we are all still in this for the long haul.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-52183713,Free school meal vouchers to continue over Easter holidays,"Teachers' unions have welcomed a government decision that means families eligible for free school meals (FSM) will continue to receive financial help to buy food over the Easter holidays. Last week ministers said qualifying families could claim shopping vouchers of £15 a week per child in term time. Now the scheme will be extended in England over the two-week holiday. Unions said the move would help prevent children going hungry, as the coronavirus pandemic continues. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove confirmed over the weekend that the vouchers would continue to be paid over the Easter holidays. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the leaders' union NAHT, said he was pleased to see the government taking action to support some of the most vulnerable children. We know that for many children, lunch at school is their only hot meal of the day and, in some cases, their only meal full stop. The government is doing the right thing in stepping forward and making sure all children can continue to access the food they need. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: Many struggling families will be finding it even harder than normal to make ends meet in the current emergency and with children at home for a long period. The extension of the voucher scheme will make a real difference in helping to alleviate the risk of children going hungry. We are particularly concerned about the impact of a prolonged shutdown of schools on these young people and their families, and are keen to work with the government on examining the full implications and what more support can be provided to them. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: ''It will be important to get the message out this week that children who qualify for FSM are covered by the national voucher scheme during the Easter holiday period. ''Parents who did not previously qualify for free school meals but whose income has reduced or stopped due to the coronavirus crisis, may qualify based on their new financial circumstances. Parents and carers should check local authority websites for how to apply. Judith Blake, chair of the Local Government Association's children and young people board, said providing for vulnerable pupils, including those on free school meals and with special educational needs and disabilities, was a top priority for councils and schools. Ms Blake said the coronavirus pandemic had forced thousands of families into financial insecurity and warned that many parents who did not previously qualify for free school meals may be eligible for them. We will continue to work with the Department for Education to ensure that these families have the certainty they need, she said. Families are being issued with either an electronic voucher or gift card worth £15, to spend at supermarkets including Sainsbury's, Asda, Tesco, Morrisons, Waitrose and M&S. Around 1.3 million in children in England are entitled to free school meals and, until now, schools had been making their own arrangements."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-52221001,Coronavirus: Students angry at empty rooms rent charge,"Student leaders in England say full rent should not be charged next term on university rooms left empty by the coronavirus shutdown. But in privately run accommodation in Portsmouth, students are being told they must keep paying. What has angered them further is that the block had not been finished in time for the autumn term and students had to be put up in temporary accommodation. Property firm Prime Student Living says students are still obliged to pay. It points out they are still receiving their loans. Where the situation is so unprecedented there should be some more understanding, says Helena Schofield, president of the National Union of Students at the University of Portsmouth. Manisha Singh, who is taking a masters degree in criminal psychology at the university, says she feels like students are being walked all over. She is a resident in Stanhope House, a student housing block managed by Prime Student Living. Because of delays in completing the building she spent most of the first term in temporary accommodation - and now faces a term with the campus closed because of coronavirus. This has been upsetting and pressurising, she says. And she is angry that she has to keep paying rent for a room that will have cost almost £10,000 for the year. Yusuf Ahmed, who is studying petroleum engineering, says: They asked me to be more flexible when they were delayed. And now he thinks the property firm should reciprocate and be able to release students from contracts rather than their having to pay until the end of the annual contract in September. Eva Crossan Jory, NUS vice-president, says in the exceptional circumstances of the pandemic there is a moral duty on housing firms to give the option of a no-penalty early release from their contracts. The University of Portsmouth has switched to teaching online and has allowed students in university-owned accommodation to end contracts as many will be studying from home. But it has no control over private student buildings. The university, students' union and local MP Stephen Morgan wrote to private student accommodation firms calling on them to do the right thing and allow students to end their rental contracts early. But Prime Student Living rejected this and replied: Tenancy agreements are to remain in force and students are obligated to continue to pay remaining rent. The property firm has highlighted that students will be receiving their maintenance loans and so should be able to continue with the contracts they signed. Another student in Stanhope House, Robert Milne, says it is very annoying to pay rent knowing I will never go back to that room. The building delay that affected Stanhope House was part of a wave of dozens of unfinished building schemes that left students in the lurch last year. Mr Milne, who is studying property development, says the experience makes him think that student accommodation is in need of tighter regulation, because at present it's students who are losing out. It's grown so quickly and regulation hasn't kept pace with the expansion, he says. Professor Graham Galbraith, vice chancellor of the University of Portsmouth, called on housing providers to let students end contracts and have the certainty that they want and need at a time of distress and hardship. Across the country it is a mixed picture, with some students able to cancel rent on unoccupied rooms, while others have to keep paying. According to student housing charity, Unipol, about 60 universities in England have agreed to waive rent in university-owned accommodation next term. Others have yet to decide or could make students continue to pay. Much of student accommodation is privately run - and some of these firms are allowing students to stop paying. Unite, one of the biggest private providers, says: We will not be collecting any further payments from students who decide they don't want to return for the summer term. But this depends on students notifying Unite by 17:00 on Monday 13 April. Private housing providers iQ and Scape are also allowing students to end contracts, with a deadline of 17:00 on Thursday 9 April. Martin Blakey, of Unipol, said it was fair for both landlords and tenants to reach a compromise and share the pain. No one party [including small landlords as well as the big student property firms] should bear all the loss, he said. Universities UK said emergency legislation during the coronavirus outbreak meant all students were protected from eviction, whether renting privately or from a university."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-52010859,Last survivor of transatlantic slave trade discovered,"The transatlantic slave trade might seem like something from a distant and barbaric era - but a historian has found evidence its last survivor was alive in living memory. Hannah Durkin, at Newcastle University, had previously identified the last surviving slave captured in Africa in the 19th Century and brought to United States as a woman called Redoshi Smith, who died in 1937. But she has now discovered that another former slave, Matilda McCrear, had lived three years later. Matilda died in Selma, Alabama, in January 1940, at the age 83 - and her rebellious life story was the last living link with slaves abducted from Africa. Her 83-year-old grandson, Johnny Crear, had no idea about his grandmother's historic story. In the 1960s, he had witnessed violence against civil rights marchers in Selma, where protesters had been addressed by Dr Martin Luther King. On discovering his grandmother had been enslaved, he told BBC News: I had a lot of mixed emotions. I thought if she hadn't undergone what had happened, I wouldn't be here. But that was followed by anger. Matilda had been captured by slave traders in West Africa at the age of two, arriving in Alabama in 1860 on board one of the last transatlantic slave ships. With her mother Grace, and sister Sallie, Matilda had been bought by a wealthy plantation owner called Memorable Creagh. Dr Durkin says there must have been a dreadful sense of separation, loss and disorientation for these families. Matilda's mother had lost the father of her children and two other sons left behind in Africa. And in the US she had been powerless to stop two daughters being taken from her, sold to another owner and never seen again. Matilda, Grace, and Sallie tried to escape the plantation soon after they arrived but they were recaptured. The abolition of slavery, in 1865, brought emancipation but Matilda's family still worked the land, trapped in poverty as share-croppers. It seems Grace did not ever learn much English. But Matilda's story is particularly remarkable because she resisted what was expected of a black woman in the US South in the years after emancipation, Dr Durkin says. She didn't get married. Instead, she had a decades-long common-law marriage with a white German-born man, with whom she had 14 children. It also seems likely that her partner was Jewish, says Dr Durkin. The couple's relationship was astonishing for its era, she says, crossing boundaries of race, class, religion and social expectation. And Matilda changed her surname from Creagh, the slave owner's, to McCrear. She was remarkably strong willed, Dr Durkin says. Even though she left West Africa when she was a toddler, she appears throughout her life to have worn her hair in a traditional Yoruba style, a style presumably taught to her by her mother, says Dr Durkin, whose research is published in the journal, Slavery and Abolition. She also carried the facial markings from a traditional rite in Africa. In her 70s, Matilda set out on another journey, travelling for 15 miles on dirt roads to a county courthouse to make a claim for compensation for her enslavement. By then, she was one of a small number of surviving slaves from Africa who seem to have made contact with each other. There was a settlement near Mobile, Alabama, of descendants of slaves from the same ship as Matilda, where the West African language of Yoruba was spoken. In the Deep South in the 1930s, this bid for compensation, brought by a poor, black, female, former slave, had little chance of a sympathetic hearing and her claim was dismissed. But such a provocative idea, reparation for slavery, attracted local press attention and the interviews helped to fill in some details of her life. When she died, with the still raw history of slavery remaining a difficult and dangerous topic, there were no obituaries - and no recognition. There was a lot of stigma attached to having been a slave, Dr Durkin says. The shame was placed on the people who were enslaved, rather than the slavers. I was born in the same house where she died, said her grandson, Mr Crear. And although his family knew Matilda was originally from Africa, nothing much was spoken about her life. This fills in a lot of the holes that we have about her, he says of Dr Durkin's research. But the cruelty Matilda faced is no surprise to him. From the day the first African was brought to this continent as a slave, we've had to fight for freedom, he says. He grew up in an era of racial segregation - and his parents put a huge emphasis on education as the way to escape poverty and the key to changing the world. But the lack of knowledge about his grandmother reflects how much of the history of slavery still lies below the surface. It doesn't surprise me that she was so rebellious, Mr Crear says. In the civil rights protests, they were singing songs with roots in the years of slavery, he says, tapping into the same continuous struggle and fight and pursuing the same the goals of real freedom and equality as his independent-minded grandmother. It's refreshing to know she had the kind of spirit that's uplifting, he says. But it is still sobering to think how the glamour of 1940s Hollywood overlapped so directly with the lives of women and children brought in chains from Africa."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-51643556,Which children are still going to school?,"Schools across the UK are now closed to the vast majority of pupils, possibly until September. A small proportion of children are still able to attend. Schools, nurseries and childminders have been asked to provide care for those who are vulnerable - such as those with a social worker, or special educational needs. They are also open to children whose parents are key workers critical to the Covid-19 response, who cannot be safely cared for at home. However, teaching unions have urged key workers to keep their children off school as well, unless it is absolutely necessary. A child's parent is a key worker if their job is considered critical to keeping the country running and/or fighting the spread of the virus. The government has published a list of key worker jobs, including health and social care professionals, public service workers and those involved in the production, distribution, sale and delivery of food. A child only needs one parent to be a key worker to be eligible to attend school. However, some schools have asked for evidence that both parents are key workers. The aim is to provide support in school for an estimated 10% of pupils. But demand will not be evenly spread, and some schools have much higher numbers of pupils to care for. Teaching unions had expressed concerns that the list of key workers was too long, and too many parents would bring their children to school, overwhelming schools operating with a skeleton staff. However, initial feedback has been that the situation on Monday morning was manageable. Figures collected by the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) suggest that in 94% of schools, no more than 20% of pupils were attending. But schools still face challenges. NAHT head Paul Whiteman said schools urgently needed clear guidance on how to keep pupils and staff safe, including medical evidence on safe levels or attendance and density, and practical advice on the protective steps schools should be taking. Schools will also have to try to ensure children keep to the social distancing rule of staying two metres apart. Head teacher Amy Arnold, from Barnham Primary School in Norfolk, told the BBC: We're working hard to keep the children a safe distance apart - inevitably that poses some problems because some of the children are five years old, and so they're finding this tricky to understand. Any impression that it is business as usual in schools is wrong. There is no curriculum to follow, and no strict year-groups. Pupils of different ages are mixing in class, or working on projects together. As the weather improves, there will probably be a lot of physical exercise and a big push to make the education on offer creative and engaging, for example through activities such as den-building. Many schools have been setting up online learning, or preparing homework packs for children. But the effectiveness of this depends on families having internet access and devices pupils can use, and also on whether adults can supervise learning. The government advises that all people - adults and children - observe social distancing, which makes indoor playdates pretty much impossible. Children can still play outdoors - with appropriate oversight - but must stay at least two metres apart from other children. They should not take part in team games or share toys, and should wash their hands regularly. Health experts also say that it's best to avoid high-touch surfaces, like playgrounds and sports equipment, as the disease can live on surfaces for some time. Summer exams have been cancelled in England, Wales and Scotland. This includes GCSEs and A-levels in England and Wales, plus primary school national curriculum tests, known as Sats, in England. In Scotland, Highers and Nationals will not be going ahead. Exam watchdogs have been working together on alternative arrangements for students who were due to sit important exams, such as GCSEs and A-levels. The Department for Education has announced that in England, teachers will be asked to submit the grade they believe the student would have received if exams had gone ahead, based on their performance in mock exams and classwork. The exam board will then combine this information with other relevant data, including prior grades, and produce a calculated grade for each student. Students will be provided with these calculated grades by the end of July. If they are unhappy with the outcome, they will have the right to appeal, to sit the exams early in the next academic year, or to re-sit in the summer of 2021. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are also planning to award grades for equivalent exams on the basis of coursework, teacher assessment and prior grades.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52184444,Coronavirus: 'I was asked for £430 a month for my shut nursery',"When Farrah Sharif, 30, was told she would have to continue paying 80% of her two-year-old son's nursery fees to hold his place in the coming months, she was confused. Like millions of other parents she had already taken him out of their east London nursery because of government guidelines, so she didn't feel she should pay anything. We asked them whether they would be applying for the government's worker retention scheme and the other financial support, but they were really unclear. Lots of parents complained and they said they would drop the fees by another 40%, but we still didn't feel that was right. So we said we would pay for March and then review the situation. To her surprise the nursery emailed her back and said it was taking her son Zayn off the register, suggesting she had been ungrateful. I was really upset, I felt my son was being penalised for something beyond his control, she says. Since 21 March, UK nurseries have only been allowed to serve the children of key workers, leaving many almost empty and forcing some to temporarily shut. But some parents are still being asked to carry on paying some or all of their monthly fees as a retainer to hold their child's place, with bills stretching to more than £1,000 in some cases. Nurseries say it is because they are struggling. As small businesses, they can access the government's Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which covers 80% of a workers' salaries if they are put on paid leave, as well as a one-year business rates holiday. But many say that is not enough. But while some parents say they are happy to pay, others - particularly those who have lost jobs or are facing financial uncertainty - say the cost is too much to bear. Ashleigh Seymour, 26, from Romsey says she is angry at having to pay a 30% retainer to keep her three-year-old son's Hunter's place, setting her back more than £200 a month. We both have gym memberships, but gyms have closed and they don't expect you to keep paying for a service they can't provide. I don't see why the burden should fall on parents. It's come at a bad time as her husband, who runs his own limited company, has seen his income totally dry up and will get little government support. But she says she will have to pay as it's impossible to get a full time nursery place where she lives. Fiona Peart, 37, from London wouldn't mind contributing something to hold her two-year-old's place, but not the 100% she has been asked for, which is about £800 a month. All my friends have been asked for between 0% and 20% and some friends got a refund for the last week of March when their nurseries were closed. We can afford it but is not ideal. My husband's hours have been reduced and who knows if we'll even have jobs in a few months? But Caroline Marks, who runs First Steps nursery in Poole, says the criticism is unfair. Government funding issues, huge business rates, minimum wage, employer pensions, rising food and fuel costs have all had a very detrimental effect on the sector and many nurseries are close to the sustainability threshold, she said. We proposed that our customers pay a 25% retainer fee if they are able to afford it to help keep us afloat until normal service resumes. Another nursery owner, who is charging 40%, said she was operating at a loss by staying open for just seven key worker children. Quite simply put, if the parents don't contribute something towards nursery fees, we would have to close. The combined rent, other overheads such as refuse collection (who won't suspend the service) and staff costs for these children mean we are losing money. The National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA), which represents the sector, says the vast majority of nurseries are not charging parents during the shutdown, and those that do will have no other choice. It says many still have to pay overheads as well as making up the shortfall in their staff's incomes. Few can claim virus-related losses on their insurance, either. Nurseries are vital now as ever to support children of key workers and vulnerable children so we need them to be staffed and operational, boss Purnima Tanuku OBE says. They need to be able to pay their staff to maintain continuity when this settles down. Some parents have said that they will not pay the retainers, while others have successfully lobbied to secure discounts. Lawyers say parents have a lot of leverage as they can threaten to withdraw their children, however the legal picture is unclear. Private nurseries, which deliver most provision in the UK, set their own terms and conditions and may include emergency closure clauses in their contracts. But the NDNA says these are designed for things that close the nursery for a few days like fire, flood and vandalism and have not been tested in a situation that could last for weeks or months. Last week, Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat MP for Oxford West and Abingdon, called on the government to offer more financial support, saying some parents were being pushed into unnecessary hardship. A Department for Education spokesperson said: We expect nurseries to take a reasonable and proportionate approach to fees paid by parents, in light of these unprecedented circumstances, and to communicate any arrangements clearly with parents. It added: We continue to fund them for the free entitlements for the duration of these closures, even if children are not attending. We have also put in place a significant package of financial support."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/disability-52149219,Coronavirus: 'I know my life will not be saved in this pandemic',"Lucy Watts MBE is 26 years old and preparing to die if she contracts coronavirus. The disability advocate has a life-limiting condition which includes multiple organ failure and restrictive lung disease requiring 24-hour care. As the British Medical Association (BMA) releases guidance preparing doctors to make brutal decisions and prioritise treatment for those most likely to recover, Lucy fears that if she contracts Covid-19 she will not be saved. My life is devalued on the basis of my disabilities and needs, rather than my life and the difference I have made to the world, she says. This is an edited version of a blog Lucy wrote over several days, trying to make sense of her personal situation I know full well in this Covid-19 pandemic that my life is not one that will be saved. This is part-writing therapy, part-rant. It's full of anger and hurt and fear. It's trying to make peace, it's wanting to fight back. And it's true, every last word. I will be isolating for a minimum of 12 weeks, possibly longer. I have 24-hour care needs, and am usually cared for by intensive care nurses for 16 hours per day, but my nurses could be recalled to the NHS at any time. My mum can manage the nursing role, but she can't do my care 24/7. We are practising strict infection control. I have made the difficult step to say that if I get Covid-19, I will not be going to hospital. I will be considered too frail, too unlikely to survive and too difficult to be weaned off ventilation on the other side - I have respiratory muscle weakness and therefore I'm unlikely to return to a meaningful quality of life - and that's only IF I survived. This situation is about who has the greatest chance of survival. I have had to accept this over the last few days. It doesn't sit comfortably with me. I rage and cry that my life is devalued on the basis of my disabilities and needs, rather than my life and the difference I have made to the world. I'm the 9th most influential disabled person in Britain, I have an MBE for services to young people with disabilities and in 2019 I became a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts for my commitment to disability rights. I have more than proved my worthiness of being alive, but it counts for nothing in this pandemic. I've changed hearts and minds through work, passion, determination, skills and experience. But my life will not be deemed worth saving where cut-throat (metaphorically) decisions have to be made due to limited resources and the large numbers infected with Covid - we're struggling now, and we're not yet near the peak. Whilst the decision not to go to hospital is mine, the decision about treatment is not within my control. I have to accept my life is not a priority and will not be saved. But as much as it makes me livid and distraught, I am a level-headed person who knows this is about saving those who have the highest chance of survival. My body is on its last legs. I have so much going on - a nameless syndrome that stops cells making enough energy for my organs and muscles to work. I have multiple organ failure, restrictive lung disease and respiratory muscle weakness, a bowel that is always in and out of obstruction, chronic pancreatitis that keeps flaring up, an immune system that doesn't fight infection well and a new issue causing joint pain and fever 80% of the time. And yet I have managed to survive sepsis 14 times - is that not a great track record? Doesn't that show, despite how weak and fragile my body is, I've got a 100% success rate in surviving life-threatening events? But do I have a high enough chance of surviving this virus - potentially at the expense of someone else's life? It's a funny head space to be in, feeling like I want to live at all costs, but knowing efforts to prolong my life could cost someone else's. I've gone through the stages of grief - denial, anger, bargaining, depression - but the end of this cycle for me does not end in acceptance. I do not accept this. I do not accept that my life is less worthy to be saved. Does it end in understanding? Yes, to an extent, I understand. I cannot accept I'm not worth saving, but I understand why it has to be this way. I understand it's not personally levied against me. It's a pandemic in which we have so few resources. I just want to live. I have so much to do, so many plans, so many ideas. My life matters, my life is worthy, my life is valuable. But we're in a crisis of innumerable proportions, and people on the frontline have to make heart-breaking decisions. Decisions that aren't fair in any way, but still have to be made. I say thank you to the NHS, for all everyone is doing. I may make it out the other side of this pandemic; I may not. One thing I can say, however, is that the NHS has kept me alive against the odds for years. It gave me the ability to live an amazing life and to achieve great things and make a difference in the world. My life matters now and it matters after this. I've created a legacy to be proud of. Although Lucy is only presuming she will not be treated in hospital and thankfully does not have Covid-19, the BMA's ethical guidance does prepare doctors that they will face agonising choices over who gets potentially life-saving treatments, including ventilation. It says: It is legal and ethical to prioritise treatment among patients, and urges doctors to consider: Severity of acute illness; presence and severity of co-morbidity; frailty or, where clinically relevant, age. The BMA says managers and senior doctors will set thresholds for admission to intensive care units - patients whose probability of dying, or requiring prolonged intensive support, exceeds the set threshold would not be considered for intensive treatment. Julian Sheather, an ethical advisor for the BMA, said: In our present circumstances, the question will no longer be how best to meet individual need, but how to maximise benefits. It is preferable to save the lives of three patients with high need and a high likelihood of benefiting than one patient with high need and a low - but nonetheless real - chance of benefiting. This is the heart of the moral challenge. Edited by Beth Rose For more Disability News, follow BBC Ouch on Twitter and Facebook, and subscribe to the new Cabin Fever Podcast on BBC Sounds.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-52151411,Coronavirus: The impossibility of home-schooling a nation,"When UK schools closed their doors amid the coronavirus crisis a couple of weeks ago, a second - and for some, horrifying - epidemic started to spread: that of home schooling. Children returned home laden with homework packs or, in some cases, full online timetables and parents made uneasy transitions into teachers of maths, English and science. Feelings of incompetence machine-gunned kitchen tables - ricocheting into darkly comic social media posts. Messages like, if you see my children picking weeds and crying in the garden, they're on a field trip, received thousands of likes. Some, lucky enough to be able to work from home, set about scheduling their jobs around the demands of their children's education. But as we reach the Easter holidays, many will be wondering: how long can I keep this up? Mother-of-three Laura Hughes says she abandoned her ambitious timetable a week-and-a-half into lockdown. I had rather naively hoped that I could get the younger two to work through a page or two of their home-learning packs with minimal supervision, allowing me to read or reply to a few work emails, she said. The reality has been somewhat different. Although her 11-year-old daughter has been able to work independently, it has been nearly impossible with her seven-year-old twins. I spend more time refereeing squabbles and pulling them apart when they fight, than doing schoolwork with them, she lamented. Staying calm when they are all running amok or point-blank refusing to open their books is the biggest challenge. They've now moved to a much looser routine of a few basics. Cleo Thomas, is supporting parents of toddlers and babies, while trying to get her 15-year-old son, Kalyan, to rise at the same time each day, eat breakfast and do at least some work. The school is still setting homework. If he does it, it's the bare minimum of five to 10 minutes. But the school wants more than that and it's really hard to get them to realise that they have to continue. I have medical issues, and I don't want to scream and start to get angry. It raises my blood pressure and makes me more likely to get ill. He's going to be in the GCSE stream for next year and I really feel for them - when they do do back to school they're going to have to start catching up. By the fifth day of England's lockdown, teachers and heads had already had enough. The main teaching unions put out some common-sense guidance stressing saying it was not business as usual for schools - or parents. Children can't be expected to be able to study full-time with online resources, National Education Union joint-general secretary Mary Bousted said. Similarly, parents - many of whom will also be working from home - cannot be expected to be supervising heavy school workloads for their children. Many schools have since adopted sensible approaches, she says, but others have not. It is essential that heads ensure neither staff, pupils or parents are overwhelmed and confused by unrealistic expectations. The joint-guidance recommends no more than three hours' work a day. For some, who are able to be at home with children, that might be a relief. For others, who return late from a shift in a supermarket or hospital, three hours may seem like an impossibility. This isn't about parents replacing the teacher, says Professor Becky Francis, a big player in education and academia. It's about encouraging parents to help their children create regular routines and study habits. It's well-known in teaching circles that pupils slip back over the summer holidays, so its understandable that teachers and parents will want to limit that by encouraging work at home. But Prof Francis says poor children tend to be most affected academically by being out of school. She is pretty certain that any gaps in achievement between richer pupils, will be widened as a result of the school shut down. Carrie Adamson, a Manchester Metropolitan University PhD student who is studying home schooling, points out all children are now out of school. Some young people may be left alone or with other siblings looking after them, she says, adding that it's not fair for parent working hard or worrying about sick friends to be expected to take on schooling responsibilities too. Not everybody has access to a periodic table jigsaw, bulging bookshelves and craft materials, she says. Some head teachers have called for schools to be able to make up for lost time, by repeating the summer term. Head of the Association of School and College Leaders Geoff Barton thinks there could be a push for a fresh start. This is going to need something of a national renewal. We'll want something pretty substantial to re-establish patterns of learning, habits of schooling, the resocialisation of the UK's young people. And that will probably be true for parents too."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-52237664,Coronavirus: Universities warn of going bust without emergency funds,"Universities across the UK are calling for emergency funding of at least £2bn, warning some institutions will go bust without it. Universities UK says the coronavirus pandemic is threatening to sharply cut overseas student numbers and put universities in financial danger. They are asking for controls on student numbers in each university, to keep fee income at similar levels to last year. Universities are promising to honour any offers already made to students. Without government support, some universities would face financial failure, others would come close to financial failure and be forced to reduce provision, says a letter from higher education leaders to ministers across the UK. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, says the proposals would help universities to weather the very serious financial challenges posed by Covid-19. He says academic researchers have made a huge contribution to tackling the coronavirus pandemic - and their expertise will be needed in the recovery of the economy and communities following the crisis. They are calling for an extra £2bn in research funding and on top of that to provide emergency loans for universities that faced significant income losses. Targeted support should be available to protect strategically important subjects such as science and medicine, say the industry leaders. This would be in response to cash pressures from the pandemic: There have been warnings of unprecedented volatility in this year's admissions - which, if left unchecked, could see some universities expanding but others left with too few students to be financially viable. This is a particular risk for universities in England and Wales, which are highly dependent on tuition fee income. In response, Universities UK is asking for controls on the number of students each university in England and Wales can recruit this year, keeping them to levels expected before the coronavirus outbreak, to stop financially unsustainable swings in numbers. The scale of concern was suggested in an internal email from a Russell Group university seen by the BBC this week, which warned the university could lose a quarter of its income next year. The letter from Universities UK to ministers says that to provide stability for students currently applying, all offers already made would have to be honoured if students made the required grade. There is also a call to push back by a year the point at which European Union students are categorised as overseas students, when they will face higher fees and visa restrictions. Jo Grady of the UCU lecturers' union said the plan was a piecemeal approach that fails to recognise the size of the problem, or the damage we risk doing to our academic capacity. Eva Crossan Jory, vice president of the National Union of Students, said any extra funding must support students, especially considering the mounting discontent that courses are not being delivered as promised and demands for refunds. She backed calls for the government to step in to protect higher education, but said it should include refunding or all or part of the fees. The scale of the financial challenges facing higher education institutions are clearly very serious, said Scotland's Deputy First Minister John Swinney. He promised to work closely with universities to help them emerge from this crisis. A Welsh government spokesman said universities had been at the forefront of the battle against the coronavirus and ministers would work to ensure they had the necessary investment. In England, a Department for Education spokeswoman said: The outbreak poses significant challenges to the sector and the government is working closely with universities to understand the financial risks and implications they might face at this uncertain time."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52228772,Coronavirus: 'Worryingly low number' of at-risk children in school,"A worryingly low number of vulnerable children allocated a school place to keep them safe during the coronavirus crisis are actually turning up, officials have told BBC Newsnight. In some areas just a quarter of the at-risk children who are meant to be in school are believed to be attending. The figure is thought to be below 10% in some parts of the UK. These low attendance rates are concerning professionals working to protect these children. Norfolk's Chief Constable Simon Bailey, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead on child protection, told Newsnight: Is it possible that we will see a coronavirus impact upon child sexual abuse? Yes I think it's possible, in exactly the same way as I've got to work on the premise that we will also see more children groomed and abused online. The school attendance figures for Norfolk's vulnerable children are 13%, Chief Constable Bailey said. It is a worryingly low statistic at the moment. When a child is in school, in the vast majority of cases they are safe, they are protected, he said. Of course there will be any number of reasons why those children are not there. Some might have underlying health issues and their parents are being completely responsible by not putting them into school. But I think there are a number of risks and I fear that children are being exposed to the potential for familial abuse within the household, being exposed to domestic abuse again in the household and we have seen a significant increase in reports of domestic abuse nationally. Newsnight spoke to a school social worker, on condition of anonymity, who said: In one school I work with, not a single child attended who was supposed to be there last week. A good turnout in the schools I work with is under 10%. It's quite frightening. The people who deliberately hurt children… for those people, this works very much in their advantage because they do have quite literally a captive audience, they have people there who can't get away. Schools are submitting their figures to the government on the numbers of vulnerable children still attending school. Newsnight asked the education departments for England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales how many education places they had allocated for vulnerable children and how many were actually turning up. England's Department for Education said it was not publishing the figures, while the others could not supply them. England's Department for Education told Newsnight: Being in school can keep vulnerable children safe and ease pressure on families, which is why we have enabled these children to continue attending despite schools being closed for other pupils. We thank schools and social workers for the work they are doing to keep vulnerable children safe at this challenging time. We have provided guidance to help ensure that removing risks to children remain at the forefront of all efforts during this pandemic and we are supporting social workers - including those returning to the profession, to help on the frontline - to focus on those in the most urgent need.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-52145351,"Coronavirus lockdown: As Easter holidays begin, families feel strain","We may never forget the coronavirus lockdown. But are we still going to be talking to each other at the end of it? Because apart from worries about the virus, there are likely to be rising tensions in some families having to live on top of one another at home. In ordinary times, couples spend on average two-and-a-half hours together each day, says researcher into relationships Prof Jacqui Gabb of the Open University. But that was in the BC era (before coronavirus), and now we can spend 15 or 16 of our waking hours together. And throw into that combustible mix, children who are out of school. Is it going to leave us seething with irritability or bring us serenely closer than ever before? We've never lived through something like this, says Prof Gabb. Most of the usual emotional pressure-cooker points - like being cooped up together at Christmas or going on a family holiday - have clearly defined exit points. But not with the coronavirus lockdown. There are no certainties any more, she says. But there are all the ingredients for stress on relationships, she says. There are worries about jobs and money, not enough personal space, lack of childcare, not being able to do the things you enjoy, not seeing friends and the anxieties caused by the virus outbreak. I am a single parent who is a key worker. I can work from home but am finding it impossible with my six and 10-year-old at home. Work have said I can drop my hours, but will lose the pay which I can't afford. My son has immune difficulties so cannot send him to school and we live with my 84-year-old mother. Feel really stuck! Shelley-Ann on workingmums.co.uk Lack of freedoms will be felt differently, says Dr Caroline Schuster, a psychologist who has worked with families in Dorset and Wiltshire. She says people might be feeling a lack of privacy, boredom and isolation, even in a family. For all of us, kids included, there is a loss of the old way of life. Both experts are concerned about an increase in domestic violence from the lockdown. Figures from the National Domestic Abuse helpline show a 25% increase in calls for help since the lockdown began. We've also entered a strange new digital existence, with many working and socialising online. But Prof Gabb warns that self-broadcasting on social media during the lockdown can put even more psychological pressure on families. Particularly if the smugness levels get too high. Not everyone is at home in their giant kitchen. Other people are struggling to feed their kids and are going stir-crazy, she says. My parents are so annoying. I'll come downstairs and say, 'Good morning', and they'll reply, 'Good AFTERNOON'. It's like, OK, I'm a bum, I get it. From annoying parents on Twitter. The story of the lockdown is being seen through the eyes of the haves, rather than the have-nots, says Prof Gabb. It's not as easy as just put on an exercise video and bond with each other, she says. Her concerns are echoed by research from Save the Children, with the charity finding the biggest worries for parents in the lockdown are getting enough food, helping children with schoolwork and concerns about money. Children are worried about someone in their family getting sick, food shortages and not seeing friends. The loss of control over much of our everyday lives is stoking the domestic tensions. For adults used to being independent it's quite infantilising, says Prof Gabb. A sense of control is incredibly important for humans, says Dr Punit Shah, a psychologist at the University of Bath. When we feel we have no control we feel stressed - and he says there are all kinds of coping mechanisms appearing. People might take a sudden interest in exercise, or focus on cleaning their house or working on the garden, giving them a sense of control over something. It is absolutely not possible to facilitate distance-learning with a primary-aged child and work from home at the same time. The very idea is nonsense. If you're trying to do that, stop now. You can certainly have activities where your child learns, but your focus is your job, and survival. Stop trying to be superheroes. Joseph Hellett to parents in Hastings. But Dr Shah says we should be more upbeat about what might emerge from this enforced confinement - and to give ourselves more credit for how we're adapting. There could be an identity shift within families, as parents and children get to know each other better, says the psychologist. We shouldn't assume it will be negative and problematic, he says. Dr Shah says we're still finding out during this experience what helps us feel better. It might be a case of fear and clothing in the lockdown. Because in his case, Dr Shah says he feels more comfortable wearing smart working clothes when he is working from home, even if it surprises everyone else on the video conference. One of the most visible tactics for stress-busting seems to be the family pet. When you go outside everyone who isn't jogging seems to be walking a dog. There are really positive benefits, says Prof Gabb. Pets are particularly important for people living on their own, a group she thinks are not being adequately acknowledged during the lockdown. Walking a dog might also make people feel more justified in being outside - and Dr Shah says our behaviour is being heavily influenced by social pressure. This includes parents feeling made to feel guilty about not having turned overnight into an accomplished teacher for their stay-at-home children. But there are soothing words for anyone already suffering from laptop neck or Zoom ache. A primary school head teacher in Hastings sent a message telling parents not to stress or feel guilty during these strange weeks. Stop trying to be superheroes, he told them."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52180783,Coronavirus: Scientists question school closures impact,"Countries like the UK that have closed schools to help stop the spread of coronavirus should ask hard questions about whether this is now the right policy, says one team of scientists. The University College London team says keeping pupils off has little impact, even with other lockdown measures. But a scientist whose work has informed the UK strategy insists school closures play an important role. The government has said it will review its coronavirus policies after Easter. While children can catch coronavirus, they rarely get severe symptoms. But they can still spread the infection, which is why many countries have closed schools. The research, published in The Lancet Child and Adolescent Health, looked at 16 studies - some based on the spread of coronavirus, and others on seasonal flu and the 2003 Sars outbreak. The findings suggest: One of the research authors, Prof Russell Viner, said: Data on the benefit of school closures in the coronavirus outbreak is limited, but what we know shows that their impact is likely to be only small. Additionally, the costs of national school closures are high - children's education is damaged and their mental health may suffer, family finances are affected. Policymakers need to be aware of the equivocal evidence. He says policymakers must weigh up the possible harms and reopen schools at the earliest opportunity - and not necessarily wait until September if it can be done safely sooner. Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, worked on the scientific modelling that the current government advice is based on. He says the Lancet research fails to take into account the impact that school closure can have alongside other lockdown measures. When combined with intense social distancing it plays an important role in severing remaining contacts between households and thus ensuring transmission declines, he said. We have entered the third week since UK schools closed to pupils, with the exception of looking after the children of key workers and vulnerable students. Nurseries, private schools and sixth forms have also been told to follow the guidance to close their doors. At the time, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the move was necessary to apply further downward pressure on the virus to avoid a catastrophic epidemic. Chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty also explained that schools were not dangerous for children during the pandemic, but that the decision to close them would slow the rise of infections. The government says it will be guided by the science in terms of when to lift any of the restrictions it has put in place to help slow and suppress the disease. New cases and deaths from coronavirus continue to rise, suggesting the UK is not yet at the peak of the outbreak and tough restrictions are still needed to ease pressure on the NHS and save lives. The measures that have been urgently put in place to fight the virus, including school closures, work in combination with each other. While some have more of an impact than others, it may not necessarily make sense to lift just one. For example, even if schools were allowed back, the social distancing measures that we are all being asked to heed, which experts say are very effective, would probably have to remain. So children going back to school would probably still have to follow the stay-at-home advice outside of school, and also the 2m close-contact rule while in school. There's also the staff to consider - some may be in high risk groups who should not work away from home. Prof Viner says schools could have a phased comeback - banning or limiting playtimes and scheduling some part-time classes for pupils to reduce mixing, for example. There's a whole range of things that schools could do to reopen in a way that involves social distancing at schools but keeps schools open. He said that opening schools should be part of the early step away from lockdown. Dr Samantha Brooks, from King's College London and team member of the NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Emergency Preparedness & Response, said: The finding that school closures have at best only a small impact on the spread of Covid-19 is of great significance, especially linked with the sensible suggestions for how a gradual return to normal schooling could be implemented. Prof Robert Dingwall, professor of sociology at Nottingham Trent University, said: This is an important study that confirms what many of us suspected, namely that the public health benefits of school closures were not proportionate to the social and economic costs imposed on children and their families. It also underlines how the assumptions used in modelling the pandemic may rest on very flimsy foundations in terms of scientific evidence. This work suggests that UK schools could, and should, begin to reopen as soon as practicable after the initial wave of cases has passed through."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51645456,ITV drama Quiz explores Millionaire cough scandal,"See if you can answer the following multiple-choice question: Who had a hit UK album with Born To Do It, released in 2000? Most pop music fans would be able to identify the correct answer (D) fairly easily. Born To Do It was a huge album which spawned several hit singles. But former British Army major Charles Ingram had no idea who Craig David was when he was asked this as a contestant on ITV gameshow Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? in 2001. He admitted as much as he mulled over the possible answers to the £32,000 question. I think it's A1, he told host Chris Tarrant. I've never heard of Craig David, to be honest. Coldplay I've never heard of. I think I'll go for A1. So it was a surprise to everyone when he suddenly changed his mind and opted for Craig David as his final answer, seemingly for no logical reason. It was an even bigger surprise when he got all his subsequent answers correct as well, ultimately winning the show's £1m jackpot. But Ingram never received the prize money. The episode had barely finished recording when producers worked out he had an accomplice among the waiting contestants, who had been coughing every time Ingram read a correct answer aloud. If the accomplice, Tecwen Whittock, didn't know an answer, Ingram's wife Diana would cough the correct answer from her place in the audience. All three were later found guilty of deception after a lengthy trial at Southwark Crown Court in 2003. It was this incredibly audacious heist, says writer James Graham, who has adapted the coughing scandal into the three-part ITV drama Quiz. I thought of it like Ocean's Eleven or Mission: Impossible, but with very middle-class people in Wiltshire. And instead of abseiling down skyscrapers they had encyclopedias and it was about questions and answers. But essentially it's still about the robbery of a million pounds. The ITV drama is directed by Stephen Frears and stars Matthew Macfadyen as Major Ingram and Fleabag star Sian Clifford as his wife Diana Ingram. Graham first told the story of the coughing scandal in his stage version of Quiz, which played in Chichester before a successful West End transfer in 2018. He tells the story the same way on TV as he did in the theatre: twice. The first half of the stage show (and the first two episodes of the drama series) basically assume Ingram was guilty - which indeed was the finding of the courts. But the second half explores the possibility that he might have been innocent, and there is some evidence to support that theory. He was painted in the press as an idiot, someone who couldn't have possibly known the answers to those questions, recalls Graham. But you forget that he has a degree in engineering, and he applied to be accepted into Mensa and succeeded, thereby putting him in the top 2% of IQs in the country. Added to that, the coughs heard during the correct answers weren't the only coughs heard during the recording. There were plenty of coughs from audience members when incorrect answers were read out. Helen McCrory, who also features in the ITV drama, points out: Chris Tarrant didn't hear the cough, people either side didn't hear the cough, yet for some reason [Major Ingram] heard the cough, I mean, really? Now maybe he did, maybe it was a complete set up. But maybe he didn't. Graham and the production team were in touch with the Ingrams while the drama was being filmed, and the couple visited the set and met Clifford and Macfadyen, the actors who would be playing them. Diana Ingram was painted as this Lady Macbeth character, and I don't think that's who she is, Clifford says. She struck me as an introvert and a nerd, and someone who's actually quite shy, quite sweet, definitely naive. Most of the cast seem at least open to the possibility that the Ingrams could be innocent. But host Chris Tarrant thinks there is no doubt about the couple's guilt. I sat through so many hours with the police and fraud squad of tapes of the major's show, and he is so guilty, he told This Morning in November. It's like once you lock into it, it's like oh, for god's sake. Tarrant is played by Michael Sheen in the new ITV adaptation. Graham says the fact the drama is airing on ITV, the channel on which the scandal occurred in the first place, didn't affect how he wrote the story. I never had a single note [from them], they were such good sports all the way through, even though they knew from the beginning that one of the central propositions is 'were they right?' And is the perceived narrative that they were responsible for telling entirely correct? But I think there is a mischief in putting it on the broadcaster which was responsible for the story, and it also frees you up to do certain things. The TV series explores an element of the story not well-known before - the existence of a small network of quizzers around the country who would share tips about how to get on to the show and reach the jackpot. The group, who called themselves The Consortium, realised that Millionaire's researchers would always ask the same general knowledge questions over the phone when they were screening potential contestants. The Consortium shared the answers between themselves, increasing the chances of each of getting on the show. They even offered a bespoke service where a contestant could ring a number via their phone-a-friend lifeline, and their small gang of general knowledge experts would be on hand to pose as their friend and provide the answer. The drama's exploration of this group, and Ingram's contact with them, further encourages the assumption that he was guilty. When Quiz was running as a stage show, the theatre audience was given keypads and asked to vote at the end of the first half - and then again at the end of the second half - on whether they thought the Ingrams were guilty or innocent. The audience always said at the beginning that they thought they were guilty, notes Graham. But then by the end of the play, every single night, they converted to innocent. Except, weirdly, for matinees, we don't know why, he laughs. Obviously a different crowd. Quiz begins on ITV at 21:00 BST on Monday 13 April."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-52268447,"Coronavirus: Theatres need bailout to survive, warns writer James Graham","Playwright James Graham has said an aggressive government bailout is needed to save theatres from the impact of the coronavirus crisis. UK venues have been shut for four weeks, with all West End performances cancelled until at least 31 May. In several months' time, all of the reserves will have dried up and there will be no money left, Graham warned. I don't even know if there will be a theatre or film industry that we can recognise when this is all over. Graham, one of the country's leading dramatists, has turned his hit West End play Quiz, about the Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? coughing scandal, into an ITV mini-series. While some theatres have started streaming online, he told the PA news agency it was a collective artform. He explained: You need people around you to see it and do it and there is no middle ground now. If it's going to survive in any form it will need an aggressive government bailout and you either do or you don't do it. There is either theatre or there isn't any more. So there is kind of a clarity to what we need to ask government to do for it to survive and hopefully they will do it. Graham's stage credits also include This House, Ink and Labour of Love, and he penned the TV dramas Brexit: The Uncivil War and Coalition. I am already exhausted about the scale of the fight ahead because every industry, every small business, are all in the same situation and it's obviously very upsetting, he said. But because the theatres were the first to close... probably, because of the very nature of what they are, gathering people together in close proximity, they will be close to being the last buildings to reopen. Sir Andrew Lloyd-Webber recently said he does not expect theatres to reopen until the end of September. Graham continued: I am worried that to have the political argument to justify that level of arts investment again at a time when the economy will be devastated, that's difficult. I'm worried for what kind of work, what kind of artists, what kind of people, in a more dangerous climate, will be allowed to make the work. I think the default naturally goes to safety, rather than invention. I say this as a playwright who comes from a working-class background - working-class actors and artists might be the ones who struggle to find themselves back on those platforms and in those spaces. A spokesman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: We are committed to supporting our theatres during this national emergency with help available through the government's unprecedented financial package for business, workers and the self-employed. We are in regular contact with the arts and culture sector as we work on our ongoing coronavirus response which includes considering further action that may be necessary. Arts Council England has launched a £160m emergency package for venues, artists and workers across the culture sector. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-52212579,What were the most-played songs of the 2010s?,"Aah, the 2010s... Do you remember them? Back in that golden age when we were all still able to listen to music in bars, cafes, shops, stadiums, at the gym and (sometimes) even at the office. Now with the first Easter of the 2020s on lockdown, PPL and BBC Radio 2 can reveal the top 40 most-played songs on UK TV and radio, of the last decade. DJ Scott Mills will countdown the list of absolute bangers - led by Adele and Bruno Mars, with three appearances each - on the station on Monday. The top 40 most-played songs are the sounds that radio producers and broadcasters have consistently played throughout the last decade and will evoke many memories for all of us, said Peter Leathem, boss of the music licensing company which compiled the chart. Jeff Smith, head of music at Radio 2, added it's packed with universally loved, sing-along pop hits that really do stand the test of time. The new data suggests broadcasters mostly favoured songs by male solo artists, with 22 nods compared to 14 solo female tracks, while American stars outweighed home-grown performers by 18-14. Bands and groups accounted for 12 of the tracks, while that most modern phenomenon of the collab yielded seven hits. And British outlets, it seems, also preferred to give airtime to songs released that decade (34 out of 40), with just a few from the noughties and Natalie Imbruglia flying the flag for the 1990s on her own, with Torn. Rihanna, Coldplay, Lady Gaga and Katy Perry all made the top 40, however that's the last you'll be hearing of that lot in this article. Because we're about to dip straight into the top 10, which features two Brits, two women and two Pharrells. The top 10 most-played songs of the 2010s on UK TV and radio: End of Youtube post by kingsofleonVEVO First up, pop pickers, is a song that you've almost certainly heard a wedding covers band butcher since its release in 2008. It gave the Nashville guitar slingers their first UK number one, and their first Grammy win too, for best rock performance by a group. In 2017, they told Radio X how they would one day explain the song's saucy lyrical content to their kids. It's Socks on Fire, said drummer Nathan Followill. Uncle Caleb's socks caught on fire one night when I was drying them out on the heater. Use Somebody, another track off their fourth album, Only by the Night, also made the top 40. End of Youtube post by CeeLo Green As many of you will have noticed, this is actually the broadcast-friendly version of the Atlanta singer's 2010 track, written in collaboration with Bruno Mars and several others. The song, which was a dig at the music industry, ironically won him a Grammy award for best urban/alternative performance. Billboard reviewed it at the time as sounding as sunny as a '60s Motown hit and as expletive-laden as an early Eminem song. CeeLo was last seen, or heard rather, performing as the monster on the surreal ITV show The Masked Singer. End of Youtube post by OneRepublicVEVO The US pop-rock band topped the UK charts for the first time in 2013 with Counting Stars, which frontman and songwriter Ryan Tedder penned when he was trying to come up with something for Beyonce (who is notably absent from this chart). The song's accompanying video has now been viewed well over 2.9 billion times on YouTube, making it the streaming site's 14th most-viewed video ever. Not enough music videos contain crocodiles these days, do they? End of Youtube post by MarkRonsonVEVO The second biggest-selling song of the decade - on streaming and physical sales - is also the second big royalty cheque on this list for the Mars man, and gives us our first Brit too. London-born US producer/DJ Ronson, and the Hawaiian singer bagged the Brit award for best British single for Uptown Funk in 2015, when it felt like it was never off the speakers, anywhere. Fun fact: after its release though, they were legally made to credit The Gap Band as co-writers, due to the song's resemblance to the their 1979 party hit, Oops Up Side Your Head. Bruno's other songs, Locked out of Heaven, and Just the Way You Are, also appear on the top 40. End of Youtube post by BlackEyedPeasVEVO Tonight's the night / Let's live it up sang B.E.P in their 2009 hit, and I'm sure we all intend to follow that advice if we're ever allowed out again. The track was produced by superstar French DJ David Guetta and arguably saw them both at the peak of their powers. After singer Fergie left in 2015, the band went on to perform the song as part of a medley before the 2017 Champions League Final in Cardiff. However, the performance, which included fireworks, ran over time and forced the kick-off to be delayed by several minutes. Fair to say they've had better nights. End of Youtube post by justintimberlakeVEVO As well as singing the film Trolls' lead song, JT played the worrywart Branch in the DreamWorks animation. In an interview with TheWrap, he said, like his character, he was pulling his hair out over the prospect of producing a hit for some colourful mythical creatures. This wasn't just like writing a song for a movie - it was writing a song for characters that are going to sing it in the movie, he said. That part had to work, and that's the part that made it a task that none of us had ever done. He needn't have worried, as the song - which he debuted live at the Eurovision song contest - won the Grammy Award for best song written for visual media. Having been released in 2016, this is actually the most recent track in the top 10, which is weighted in favour of older songs - because its surveying plays over a whole decade - and perhaps helps to solve the mystery of the missing Ed. Sheeran's stellar 2017 track, Shape of You, came in in 38th. End of Youtube post by DaftPunkVEVO Combining the musical might of the French electronic duo, the US hip-hop star and the legendary guitarist, it was only ever going to end one way, wasn't it? Choon. Stevie Wonder even added to the talent pool by joining them on-stage to perform the modern disco-hit at the 2014 Grammys, where it won record of the year and best pop group performance. It topped almost every chart in the world, selling a million equivalent copies in the UK in just 69 days. When I think how it happened, too, with people who I like a lot, that we just decided to go into the studio and do something, Rodgers told the Official Chart Company. And then it turns out like this? It's absolutely remarkable, because no-one was prepared for this! While attempting to Get Lucky is very much against current government guidelines, dancing around your kitchen to that funky bass-line is not. End of Youtube post by Maroon5VEVO Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine attempted to brighten up one of the dullest Super Bowls in recent history by going topless as sang this ode to his hip-thrusting abilities, last year in Atlanta. The 2010 track peaked at number two in the UK but topped the US charts, meaning Christina Aguilera became only the fifth female to score number one singles in three different decades, after Janet Jackson, Madonna, Spears and Cher. But it still wasn't enough for her to get invited back to the greatest show on earth to perform. Incidentally, last year, Sir Mick Jagger - the 76-year-old Rolling Stone referenced in the song's title - posted a video of himself dancing at home following heart surgery, to prove he still had his signature moves. The Los Angeles band's other big hit of the decade, Payphone - featuring rapper Wiz Khalifa - also gets a mention in the top 40. End of Youtube post by AdeleVEVO The opener from Adele's Brit award-winning second album, 21, was essentially her big comeback track following the breakthrough success of her debut, and also the moment she became a real star in the States too. The gospel-tinged vibes of the pounding 2010 track saw her pick up three Grammys - record and song of the year, plus best short-form music video. The visuals found her alone in an abandoned room which soon began to fall apart, like the relationship she was singing about. After Mark Ronson, the Londoner is the only other British-born artist (and second woman) to appear in the top 10... and he mostly grew up in New York. Someone Like You and Set Fire to the Rain, from the same blockbuster album, also made the top 40 mix. End of Youtube post by PharrellWilliamsVEVO So there you have it! An upbeat and inoffensive top 10. The appearance of Mr Williams' second ubiquitous earworm of the 2010s confirms there is no room at all at the top table for Drake, Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber or Ariana Grande. Possibly as while they are popular with younger audiences, radio and TV has to appeal to a much broader listenership. Happy was another track written for an animated film; namely Despicable Me 2, and it fast became the eighth biggest-selling song in UK chart history. A live rendition of the song eventually scored the singer/rapper a Grammy, after he previously lost out in the best original song category to Let it Go, from Disney's Frozen. When they read the results, my face was... frozen, Pharrell told GQ magazine. But then I thought about it, and I just decided just to... let it go. With Lucky and Happy enjoying great success, we look forward to seeing which of the remaining seven dwarves he'll name his hits after in this new era. (Joke... we know Lucky isn't one really).

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-52156963,Laura Marling: 'I was in danger of being bored of myself',"Three years ago, Laura Marling's sixth album, Semper Femina, ended with the sound of her putting down her guitar and walking out of the studio and into a garden. Then a door closed and the listener was left alone, in silence. It was a cryptic reference, the singer explained, to Henrik Ibsen's play A Doll's House, in which with a woman walks out on her husband and children in an effort to discover herself. Marling continues the theme on her new album Song For Our Daughter, which was released earlier than planned, as a response to the coronavirus lockdown. The opening song, Alexandra, is a response to Leonard Cohen's Alexandra Leaving that wonders where Cohen's lover went after she left. What became of Alexandra? Did she make it through? asks Marling. What did Alexandra know? End of Youtube post by Laura Marling - Topic There's no mention of her interior life, in Cohen's song, the singer explains. There's no suggestion that she has an interior life that's anything more than [being] alluring. And that's interesting to me as an autonomous young songwriter who has an interior life, and who has been projected on and survived, what can be quite an overwhelming passionate experience. So I wanted to give Alexandra a voice of her own, or to find out what happened to Alexandra and the consequences of surviving that relationship. Marling returns to the subject of departing lovers on Fortune, a deceptively pretty ballad where a woman ends her marriage with quiet devastation: I had to release us from this unbearable pain. The song was inspired by the revelation that her music teacher mother used to keep a running away fund in case she ever felt the need to flee the family. I was having dinner with my sisters one night, she recalls, and my eldest sister said, 'Do you remember that our mother used to keep one pound coins in a pot above the washing machine?' And I was like, 'Oh, yeah.' It added up to like £350 or something - by no means enough to run away with - but that was her collection over a lifetime. And I just thought that was so tragic in a perfect way, that generation's attempt at carving out their own little bit of freedom. Marling, who turned 30 earlier this year, has never felt the need for a running away fund of her own. I am my escape route, she says. Which is why, at the end of Semper Femina, she wasn't walking away from anyone or anything; but setting off to find a new approach to music. The songs she came up with after that last album seemed too familiar, like a writer who'll write the same book over and over again, she says. I think I was in danger of being bored of myself. So she left her record label and her management, collaborated with the theatre director Robert Icke, wrote original music for Peaky Blinders and formed a duo called Lump with fellow musician Mike Lindsay from Tunng. Working on Icke's play Mary Stuart changed her approach to lyrics. The way he directs and the way he writes and rewrites plays, are very much based around rhythm, so I've been thinking a lot about the rhythm of language, she says. Lindsay, on the other hand, introduced a new spontaneity to her music. With Lump, a lot of the vocals are recorded in one take, and I can hear myself stumbling over lyrics because they were written 30 seconds before. But Song For Our Daughter is wholly Marling's album. Her preoccupations - the complexities of desire, archetypes of womanhood, art, romance and wanderlust - are threaded through the songs, but there's a newfound economy to her melodies and lyrics. That was definitely on my mind: How you reduce everything down to its essential parts together to get the sentiment across, she says. And I don't think that's my necessarily my forte. My forte, I think, is ambiguity, which is definitely still on there, but on some of the songs there's just a very straightforward sentiment. The approach is most apparent on the album's closing track, For You, a simply-strummed love song, written at home with her boyfriend. I thank a God I've never met, never loved, never wanted / For you, she sings. I wear a picture of you, just to keep you safe. The song, she says, is a little homage to Paul McCartney at his warmest and most open-hearted. She's a late convert to the former Beatle, having previously been a steadfast Lennon fan. I had a fight with a friend of mine, weirdly, defending Lennon against McCartney, she says. And I took it so personally. For some reason I felt like Paul McCartney was the good one and Lennon was the bad one and I was somehow embodying the bad one - so I thought it'd be interesting to see why I felt that strongly about it. After falling down a YouTube wormhole, Marling had a full awakening after hearing McCartney's 2005 song, Jenny Wren, a companion piece to Blackbird, whose lyrics depict a female musician's struggle to hold on to her talent amid poverty, societal oppression and heartbreak. I always knew he was a great songwriter but when someone played me that song, I couldn't believe it, she says. It's likely that McCartney's lyrics resonated with Marling, who has consistently challenged the narrow categorisation of female musicians. She never casts herself as simply the femme fatale or the lover scorned; the heroine or the victim; the mystic or the guardian angel. Instead, she throws herself into the murky complexities of real life. As she puts it on one new song: I love you my strange girl, my lonely girl, my angry girl, my brave... Recently, the songwriter looked back at her emergence in London's nu-folk scene at the age of 16 - at how men would advise her to lose the guitar and become a traditional frontwoman, or how early press coverage defined her in terms of her relationships with Marcus Mumford and Charlie Fink from Noah and the Whale. She came to realise and realised that innocence being taken away prematurely had been a major theme of her life, which is why the songs on her new album are intended arm the next generation in a way that I haven't been armed. I thought, 'If my daughter went through any of the stuff that I went through, I would find that so emotionally difficult to to comprehend'. And that's not to say that my parents didn't do their very best to try and produce someone who was capable of looking after themselves in the world, but the culture didn't. The culture didn't provide that. It's striking that her previous album, which dissected the male gaze and celebrated the strength of female relationships, emerged just before the #MeToo movement took hold. How did Marling feel about those revelations, given her own experiences? That's a big question, she says. I'd obviously been thinking about all that stuff - and I felt like I was late to it - but then, the culture was even later. I think it's unfolding on a mass scale in the same way trauma unfolds. You're trying to get the story straight, and then [you realise] the story doesn't matter, it's just what the experience was. The title track of her new album depicts a woman whose clothes [are] on the floor, taking advice from some old, balding bore, a cautionary tale, based on stories she's heard from every single female friend, and a fair few male friends too. But she sees hope in the musicians half a generation younger than me who are much more ready to call out stuff that I wasn't ready to do when I was in my early 20s. Their understanding of trust and consent is very different, in a good way, and that is radical. I feel incredibly heartened by it. I think it's going to change everything.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-52228541,How live theatre is still running despite lockdown,"Since Covid-19 closed auditoriums worldwide, theatres have been picking tapes of shows from the library shelf to stream online for those feeling play-starved. But a few performers are attempting something more radical - regularly live streaming performances from home. There’s an audience - but it’s not easy to make the technology work. Brian Lonsdale has made a living from acting for 17 years. He's based in Newcastle, where there's a family to feed and, these days, to home school. “When coronavirus started to kick in I was having a Twitter chat with a couple of actor mates discussing what the next few months would bring,” he says. “Acting isn't exactly a secure profession and everything was just collapsing. So we invented the Coronavirus Theatre Club (CTC) and it took off.” CTC is an online platform for writers, directors and actors, he explains. “They submit work to us. They rehearse digitally and then each Sunday at 7pm we stream five live monologues back to back. “I'm pretty much working at it every hour of the day; hundreds and hundreds of theatre people just want to work. “I look at the scripts submitted and then pair actors with directors and see who wants to do what. I've been learning so much. Each day I'll realise there's something I can't do or something I should be doing. My life as an actor has been to learn lines, say them on stage and then it's off to the pub. “Now I'm splitting the work with my colleagues Sam Neale and Michael Blair and the response has been fantastic. We had 1,000 followers within two hours.” CTC streams the monologues on Twitter, he explains. “Each actor is at home in front of their phone which they prop up or maybe have on a tripod. I give them an exact start time and that should be all they have to worry about; they know to begin at 7.13pm or whatever. “They're live on their Twitter account and I stream them to the Coronavirus Theatre Club account. It's my job to try to make it seamless.” Already they're contemplating extending beyond mere monologue, says Lonsdale. “Lots of performers will be self-isolating with other actors so we could for instance do two performers together - or even have a scene split between different parts of the country.” The CTC hasn't so far ventured into musical performance. But that's the focus of Leave a Light On, run by production company Lambert Jackson, which mainly presents concert performances of musicals. There's a charge for the shows, using the Theatre Cafe website as a portal. Currently there's an ambitious schedule of three 45-minute gigs daily at 14:30, 16:30 and 18:30 BST. They're solo performances from kitchens or living rooms - a real test of performers' vocal skills (and taste in home decor). Until now they’ve been live but they’re about to move to a recorded format. Eliza Lambert says the problem has been the connection at performers’ homes. “Shows will still be ‘as live’, which audiences love. But there’s no point lining up great performers if the technology isn’t reliable, and of course broadband is under pressure now.” Lambert says the concerts are helping the relatively new company tick over financially. “But we also knew so many friends who are performers who were desperate to keep working. So we devised our series with West End performers - some have a fan base and some are just starting out. “They sing some of their favourite songs - sometimes what they've been singing on stage or sometimes it's Little Mix or Frank Sinatra. “We have a tech team which contacts them and talks through where to place the phone and they do a sound check. Usually there's eight or nine songs.” For some shows there have been more than 1,000 people watching live (there's no archive as yet). Everyone wants a high level of production so the obvious problem was providing music to sing to. “Some performers accompany themselves on piano or guitar or even a ukulele,” says Lambert. “Otherwise our music director Josh Winston goes through the set list and we supply a piano track for use on the day. It's amazing how quickly we devised a method for all this when we had to.” Lambert Jackson has constructed an impressive operation on the back of an existing company. However, Barry McStay, an Irish actor based in London, set up National eTheatr from scratch. It started as a live operation but he concluded that going live provides too many technical challenges for a small operation. He's decided to proceed with new but recorded material. His chosen platform is YouTube, he explains. “We do 7.30pm four evenings a week - 7.30pm just feels the right time for theatre. “My initial idea was also to provide a four-way video interview with me, the writer, the director and the performer so we'd have a discussion around the monologue and not just the piece itself. “But I soon realised all the streaming services are under pressure because so many people are online each evening in lockdown. It just wasn't stable enough. “Also it seemed I'd started a major new admin job while locked away in my flat - that wasn't the plan at all so I needed to simplify. “So now it's recorded which is more reliable but there's still a live text chat so people can give their opinions. And the pieces are all there for people to enjoy afterwards.” Some eTheatr monologues relate to Covid-19 but not all. One recent piece was The Cloak of Invisibility, about a middle-class London mum who loses her job. “What matters really is the quality of the writing and the performance,” says McStay. “I didn't want everything to be coronavirus.” Marianka Swain is the journalist who runs the UK side of the American theatre website Broadway World. “We've had a lot of success in the shutdown with our Living Room Concerts series with performers from musicals like Lauren Drew and Christina Bennington,” she says. “So far we're not going down the live route but it's something the site has done and I can see the argument for it. “It would be great to reproduce the shared experience which is one of the strengths of being in a theatre. Swain says there is no reason why the new breed of streamed drama shouldn't continue alongside offerings from major venues like the National Theatre. “When the National streamed One Man, Two Guvnors recently (the hit 2011 comedy with James Corden) it got a really big audience,” she says. “But what was obvious was the amount of chatter about the whole experience on social media: I'm sure it drew in people who would never have gone to see it in the Lyttelton theatre. “So coronavirus is making us explore new ways of doing drama. But of course performers and audiences will be so happy when we all get back into a theatre again.” Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-52209306,Easter treats: Will Gompertz reviews the best lockdown entertainment ★★★★★,"When I was 11, my father gave an LP to me by a middle-aged American man called Bob Newhart. I'd never heard of the fella. But then I'd never heard of Louis Armstrong before Dad introduced me to his exuberant trumpet-playing when I was seven. Nor Frank Sinatra, whom I first listened to on a cassette in the old man's car when I was five. They turned out to be good. Dad was in credit. This was 1976. The year the Sex Pistols played the Lesser Free Trade Hall in Manchester and the Ramones released their debut album. I could see from the record in my hand it wasn't that, but nor, thankfully, was it David Cassidy and The Partridge Family, which my sister played incessantly. Onto the turntable it went: The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart. Track one, side one - here we go. What? No strings? That's a departure. Perhaps Dad - a country doctor partial to a tweed suit - was edging towards a hipper minimalist sound. An MC introduces Newhart, followed by gentle applause, and then the main man takes the stage. He's not singing, he's not even playing an instrument. He's talking. About advertising. Specifically, about a conversation between Abraham Lincoln and his PR advisor. The audience is laughing. It's a comedy album! I hadn't known there was such a thing. Thanks Dad. Newhart is funny guy. His shtick is to play the straight man in an imagined conversation, the laughs are in the gaps your imagination fills - the other side of the call you don't hear leading to Newhart's responses, which become more and more surreal the longer the call goes on. What is so striking about hearing it again (there's a lot of Newhart material online), is not that how well it has aged, but that nobody I know of is doing anything like it at the moment. Not in comedy, at least. Elsewhere, the one-way conversation is all the rage in our lockdown age. Actors, musicians, and teachers are all generously giving performances and classes to unseen online audiences. As are curators, the pick of whom this week is the softly-spoken Till-Holger Borchert of the Musea Brugge in Belgium. He's inveigled his way into the Museum of Fine Arts in Ghent to give us a tour of its fabulous Jan van Eyck exhibition, which was the must-see show this spring before coronavirus wrecked havoc. The professionally filmed private view with Mr Borchert as our personal guide is nearly as good as the real thing, with the added bonus of his knowledge about one of the greatest painters of all time - the Leonardo of the North - whose recently restored Ghent Altarpiece (painted partly with his brother Hubert) is the standout star of this show. The Lake District landscape is the star of The Great Mountain Sheep Gather, a beautiful documentary that's airing at 19:00 BST on BBC Four on Easter Monday. The setting is Scafell Pike, the tallest mountain in England, from which a herd of 500 sheep must be brought down for shearing by a foot-sore shepherd. We follow him up and then down again in a 100-minute observational film that has the courage to go at his pace, which is mighty slow. The voice of Maxine Peake is heard from time-to-time, reading the specifically commissioned poetry of Mark Pajak, making for an elegiac programme the like of which I haven't seen before, but would happily watch again. The scenery is spectacular. Having got into the slow, poetic zone, I'd recommend heading online to watch a film posted recently by the director and critic Mark Cousins in response to the bug. It's called 40 Days to Learn Film, which you do in his two-hour 15 minute passion project that is an utterly charming, highly informative history of film, structured like no other, in which Cousins hops across decades, cultures, and genres with agility of a sheep on Scafell Pike. It's brilliant. As is Jesus Christ Superstar, the 70s musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, which you can see for free this weekend on the newly-established YouTube channel, The Shows Must Go On. It's the 2012 cast with Tim Minchin and Mel C. And finally, given the time of year, a steer towards the English Touring Opera, which is presenting Bach's St John Passion, free-to-see on its YouTube channel at 16:00 on Easter Sunday. The intention had been to tour the production around the country and work with a range of players and choirs, but that's not possible now. Instead, we'll get to see and hear a hybrid production that consists of film from a recent show at the Hackney Empire in London, some rehearsal footage, and contribution from regional choirs that helps fully fill the soundscape. I think it's going to be wonderful. Happy Easter. Recent reviews by Will Gompertz Follow Will Gompertz on Twitter"
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52250706,Coronavirus: Holby City donates ventilators to London Nightingale hospital,"The BBC medical drama Holby City has donated two fully working ventilators from its set at Elstree to be used in London's new NHS Nightingale Hospital. The corporation shared the news in a tweet, with a photo of workers unloading equipment from a van. Holby City executive producer Simon Harper said they wanted to help the courageous and selfless real-life medics. The drama, set in a fictional West Country city, has paused production. Fully operational ventilators from the Holby City set arrived at the new Nightingale Hospital yesterday. @BBCCasualty & @BBCHolbyCity Exec Producer Simon Harper said: We are only too happy to help out and do what we can for the courageous and selfless real life medics. pic.twitter.com/oUFaRPVhyn End of Twitter post by @bbcstudios The BBC confirmed that two new ventilators has been ordered for the production, but in a statement said they had asked their supplier to divert them to the NHS once the need for the equipment became clear. A ventilator takes over the body's breathing when disease has resulted in the lungs failing. The first of the government's emergency field hospitals to help fight the pandemic was created in just nine days, opening at east London's ExCel centre last Friday. The BBC donated the ventilators to the London Nightingale as the drama is filmed at Elstree studios, in Hertfordshire. Last month, Holby City and another BBC medical drama, Casualty, announced plans to donate protective equipment and other kit from their sets to the NHS. London's temporary Nightingale Hospital is able to hold as many as 4,000 patients and is the first of several such facilities planned across the UK. There are also Nightingale hospitals in Birmingham, Manchester, Bristol and Harrogate, with two more announced on Friday on Wearside and in Exeter. The BBC's move follows a government drive to source thousands more ventilators to help ease the pressure on hospitals caused by the pandemic. British manufacturers have answered the government's appeal by turning their operations to making novel ventilators. An order has been placed by the government for 10,000 newly-designed machines from technology firm Dyson. It came as the UK recorded its highest daily death toll since the outbreak began, with another 980 recorded hospital deaths, bringing the total to 8,958. That death toll, which does not include those who died in care homes or the community, has now exceeded the worst daily figures seen in Italy and Spain."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-52220736,Cadet Rated Legend album: Krept on his cousin's life and legacy,"On 9 February 2019, Blaine Johnson, better known as Cadet, was on his way to perform a gig at Keele University when the taxi he was in crashed, killing him and injuring the other passengers in the car. More than a year later, as his debut album Rated Legend is released, Cadet's cousin Krept reflects on their at-times complicated relationship. As told to Kameron Virk… It's hard putting private things out in the open. I do it in my music because I know how much people look at artists and think that everything's great. But when you're open and honest and let them know that you're going through just as much stuff as they're going through, it helps. It can literally save lives. That's why I've been so honest about how hard it's been for me since Cadet died. As his debut album comes out, I want to just take a minute to reflect on his life and our relationship. Some people have such mad stories that they have to figure out a way to talk about them. Cadet was 100% one of those people. He was such a talented storyteller. Anyone who's heard his music knows that. When you come from a certain place, a certain background, and you go through so much stuff… if you like doing music, you like rapping, to put it into words is not gonna be difficult. I think that's what separates a lot of people. It's just their story. But before the world knew him as Cadet, he was Blaine Johnson, my cousin. And for a period he was MC Bubbly too! Yeah. MC Bubbly. When he spat his first bar, at my dad's house in Brixton, that's what he was called. The lyric was actually good - but I was like 'Bro, you can't be called MC Bubbly'. Blaine was less than a month younger than me. So growing up we were always together. Like, always. His dad and my dad are brothers, but our mums are close too. I've got an older brother, and we were all really close. But my brother spent some time in Jamaica, and it was just me and Blaine together. It was like he was my brother. We used to spend every Sunday at my nan's. Those Sundays were a vibe. We all used to go there - Cadet, me, my dad, his dad, Cadet's sister Chandler, our nan and granddad, our auntie - sometimes other cousins too. My nan used to cook every Sunday so there was always food there. But it wasn't even just for that reason: we just used to go there, play games and buss jokes - and Cadet would be dancing. He was always dancing when we were younger. The guy loved body-popping. And he was so sick! He could've been a professional dancer if he stuck with it. I used to body pop a bit too - but he was to the point where when we used to go parties, he used to get in the middle and start body popping and everyone would go crazy. There's something else that sticks with me from that age too - an image I just can't get out of my head. I don't know why my dad did it - Cadet must've been being naughty. But we were at the petrol station, and you know where it says how much the petrol is per litre? There was a little peg on there. He lifted Blaine up and hung him on there by his pants. I just remember Blaine swinging helplessly and crying and I can't get that out of my head. I used to laugh about it every day. When we got a bit older I took advantage of the 417 bus, which went from my house in Gipsy Hill to his in Clapham Common. It dropped me literally right outside. So from when I was allowed to travel by myself, in secondary school, I'd get on there and it would take me all the way there, or he'd come to mine. Then when Cadet started living with his dad in South Norwood we used to walk to Crystal Palace from my house and jump on the 410 bus down to his dad's. Those buses are where his name came from - their brand name was Cadet. We were just on the bus and I saw the Cadet thing and I just said, Cadet! Why don't you call yourself Cadet? He was like Cadet?…. Yeah. Yeah, that's hard! We must've been 14 or 15, and ever since then he's been Cadet. I started rapping before him, just because all my friends were. They were doing sets in the ends and I was like, I need some bars to jump in the set. That's when I started writing. And then he saw all of us were spitting, so he started. The maddest thing is even when his name was MC Bubbly, the lyrics were good - I knew from then he could spit. We went to Richmond College together when we turned 16 and made a whole new friendship group. Things started changing after that though. I went to uni in Portsmouth, and Cadet started working. So we just didn't see each other. Me and Konan started making a name for ourselves at this point too. We put out our first mixtape in my first year of uni. So I'm doing uni, I'm doing music, and then we're just getting into mad problems and involved in street stuff too. It was like three different lives I was living. It was balancing bare stuff. It looked like me and Konan were already successful - and any time me and Cadet spoke, it felt like he was asking for stuff. 'Oh, can you do this for me. Can you promote that?' But we weren't making no money, we were still building. We weren't even seeing each other on Sundays now, because I was in Portsmouth. My family thought I was distancing myself. Cadet didn't fully understand until a few years later, when he was in the groundwork stage of his own career - as I call that period in mine - that I was just working. He talks about it on the new album. But we weren't speaking openly at the time. There was a communication breakdown. He used to make songs or freestyles every now and then and send shots for me. And I was like, why does he keep doing that? And then he'd ask me to promote it! I was like 'Are you alright?' It was weird. It really took off for me and Kone in the next few years. We did the remix of Otis, which went crazy viral. But it was a mad period - this was just after the situation happened with Konan, where his step-dad was killed. But we capitalised on the Otis momentum, dropped Paranormal, and ended up going on tour with Skepta. He gave us some advice - basically told us to keep doing us and not chase the labels or the radio - and we never really looked back. Mobo Awards, BET Awards and a record deal followed. But I never got a call from Cadet. I'm definitely someone who thinks 'Everyone's got their own life'. I don't expect nothing from anyone. But that was the person I was closest to my whole life, and I didn't get to share that with him. We'd still see each other sometimes, round nan's on a Sunday. And when we were together it was normal. But for me relationships aren't just about when you see each other - it's about when you're not with each other too. I'm sure at some point he would have said 'I'm proud of you'. But it wasn't how it would have been if we were close. I know that for a fact. At this point I'd had enough. I just kept thinking, 'Why are we like this? How did it get like this?' I missed that relationship - and I knew it had gone because of the music. The only thing that was gonna build our relationship back was him doing music and taking it seriously. That's when I messaged him and said 'Bro, you're coming Wireless'. I needed to inspire him. I knew how talented he was, and that if he took it seriously, he would get big. Sometimes you just need that little fire. Wireless that year was mad - there were loads of celebrities backstage. When he saw them coming up to us, he was like, 'What's going on? These man are actually getting big!' There must've been 5,000 people in the crowd that day, singing every single word back. All our friends watched us perform from the side of the stage. Cadet was the last person to leave - I could see it had worked. He was inspired. Things felt pretty normal after that. We started talking all the time - mostly about his music. As far as I was concerned, our relationship was fixed. But he was still sending shots for me on freestyles - like on Slut. I thought that was just about music, so I was like, whatever. As long as you're doing music, you can say what you want. But I didn't know all of the stuff he thought had been going on. That's when the letters came. He told me he was dropping something, to look out for it. From when I saw the title, Letter To Krept, I just knew it was gonna be honest. I was in my house in Bermondsey and watched it as soon as it was uploaded. I wanted to hear it. And then I just started writing. I was glad he did it because then it was like, now I can explain my side to you. When I heard the lyric about his girlfriend - that he thought I knew she was cheating on him, I was like, 'Rah, swear down you thought that?' Until the letter came out I had no idea he'd been thinking that the whole time. I was happy with the way it played out though. He likes expressing and telling his truth in music, and I do as well. So I was cool with how that happened. At the same time I knew that if I responded to him it was only gonna help his career. After I said what I needed to in my reply - about him asking for my help but not putting the work in himself - the air was cleared. It was back to normal. We didn't even need to build anything back up - because we'd been so close for the rest of our lives, except for that six-year period in the middle. It was the same as it was before, just with no weird elephants in the room. We finally got to witness each other flourish. I got to share those big moments I'd always wanted to with him. At this point Cadet was hitting hard with the freestyles. He knew his lane, he knew what his fans wanted, and he was delivering. And when it came to storytelling, he was in his own lane. When he spat I had to just sit back like, 'Wow. That's talent'. But he felt underrated. He didn't think he was getting his dues. I remember we all had a conversation and I said how if you tell people something enough, it becomes true. As an example, Giggs calling himself the Landlord - you end up calling him that. That was when he started calling himself Underrated Legend. It was a smart move from Cadet to put that out there, because then everyone starts saying he needs his ratings! But Cadet's thing was, 'Rapping about my life is cool, but that's not really getting me the bookings. We're not going to be able to shut down the clubs or the festivals with that.' Until Advice came. That was the hit he'd been looking for. He'd been dabbling, and he got it so right with that one. But it was almost never a song. Cadet and Deno done it as a freestyle in the car, put the video on social, and left it at that. Konan rang him and was like 'Bro. Cadet. Bro. This is a banger! Record a video and put this out ASAP'. He did, and it was his biggest song ever. After that, he just kept on going. He started feeling like he was finally getting the recognition he deserved. You see when you start getting records like that back? You start getting serious money. He was like, 'Rah, I'm about to actually join the crew'. He started getting bookings - he was booked for Wireless - and he started feeling like a real artist. I'm glad he got to feel that. He was chasing it and he got there, he knew what it felt like to have a massive record. That's something that makes the way he died so much easier for me. A month before Cadet died, I lost one of my closest friends, Nash, to suicide. I met Nash in college but we became mad tight. We were all in the same group chat - me, him and Cadet. I remember playing Broski, about Nash passing away, to Cadet. We played it and just sat back like, 'Wow. I can't believe he's gone'. Then a month later, it happened again. When I found out, I was in Dubai. My girlfriend took me for my birthday. The day before, Cadet messaged me saying, Yo cuz, I just want you to know I love you. I was like, 'You're dumb man. You're soft'. He told me he'd got me the socks I'd asked for for my birthday. The next day my friend CJ called as I was boarding my flight home. I knew something was wrong because it was late in the UK, like 2am. So for you to call me at 2am, knowing I'm abroad, something's wrong. And it's someone that doesn't call me a lot - we don't have phone conversations like that. So I know there's a reason he's calling me, and I know he's always with Cadet. I picked up and he was crying. I just knew. He didn't even have to tell me what happened. I knew exactly what he was going to say. I hung up the phone and nearly dropped to the floor. I had to put my bags down, take a seat and have a breather. My girlfriend was helping me. All I kept saying was there's no way. There's no way, there's no way, there's no way. I was trying to ring people, and eventually I got through to my dad. He was crying, and that made me cry. All this time I'm having to board a plane. It was the worst, absolute worst, worst, worst feeling I've ever had. By the time I landed home, I'd been seeing the response on social media. I could see all the love he had, I could feel it. But his mum, dad and our nan, they weren't seeing it. As adults they know that their kids are doing well as musicians, but they don't really know until they see you at a concert or something. So I needed them to see all the love that was being poured out on social media. That's why I said Hyde Park - 'Everyone come to Hyde Park, we're gonna let off some balloons for Cadet'. I needed them to see the impact that he made. At first they didn't understand why I was saying Hyde Park. They wanted to do something in Clapham. But I had to explain - this is bigger than South London. When they saw all the people they couldn't believe it. There must have been 1,000. They couldn't believe it, that he had so much love. My uncle never cries. That was the first time I've seen him break down. It was hard, it was so hard. It still is. I started to learn about what happened on the night he died. I had to speak to the people that were in the car with him. He was in a packed car and he's the only one that died. I spoke to his friend Money that was there, his DJ, and Ed his cameraman. They were all in the car. Cadet was behind the driver. The DJ was next to him, Money was on the left behind the front passenger and then Ed was in the passenger. What they found mad was the fact that they called an Uber, and they missed it. So the Uber they actually got in wasn't the original Uber they were meant to get in. They got into a second Uber and they were driving for like five minutes on country roads. They said they turned a corner and a car crashed into them. Head on collision. He died instantly. There wasn't any other major injuries. I know Ed fractured something. But no-one had life-threatening injuries. Cadet hit his head. That's what killed him. Whatever he hit is what killed him. But they weren't even meant to be in that Uber. It's like something out of Final Destination. You call an Uber, you just, JUST, about miss it. You cancel it and have to call another one and it just so happens that at that time, this guy is coming around the corner. If they got in a car one minute earlier that wouldn't have happened. If they got in that first cab, this wouldn't have happened. That's what I find mad. After the funeral I was just keeping busy. I was getting ready for his show, the Rated Legend show. We put it on in Brixton Academy on his birthday, two weeks later. It was like Avengers Assemble. Everybody was being helpful - the venue, my agent, all the artists, 1Xtra who helped with logistics. Everyone came on time, it was perfect. It was like 'Rah, all these people, these artists, they all had respect for Cadet'. After he passed, loads of producers started hitting us up saying they'd recorded songs with him. It ended up being 50, 60 songs or something. It just kept on being more and more. I was like, 'This guy was working his arse off! Why's he got so many songs?!' We tried to get a cohesive body of work out of it. That's what his mum and dad wanted. The family listened to all the songs and decided what they liked, and Rated Legend is the culmination of putting those together and finishing them off. We set up the Cadet Trust too - which funds organisations that are doing something good for young people or in the community. All these kids that we're funding and helping, when they get to where they get to in life, they're gonna be able to say 'Cadet helped me get here'. We just wanted to leave something in his name that can benefit people who are chasing their dreams. My first child is due later this year. Having something missing from your life and then having something added is a weird feeling. But I really can't wait for my daughter to arrive. It's going to help take my mind off loads of stuff, like my friends that I've lost. It feels like finally I'm gaining something instead of losing people. I know the relationship my daughter would have had with Cadet. He was so good with kids. I know for a fact, when she got old enough, he would have come over like, 'I'm taking her out'. That's the kind of person he is. He would've been an amazing uncle. For me, I just want people to know how special he is. That's what this album is. I want people to listen to it, and to hear this amazing body of work he made without even trying to. I want people to think, 'Wow, imagine if he'd been trying to make an album?' I want people to see how much potential he had. And I want people to no longer call him underrated - he's surpassed that now. Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-52268441,"Tim Brooke-Taylor: Cleese, Fry and more pay tribute to comedy 'hero'","John Cleese, Stephen Fry and David Mitchell have paid tribute to wonderful comedian Tim Brooke-Taylor after his death at the age of 79. Cleese, who co-starred with Brooke-Taylor in the 1960s and 70s, said he was a great performer and companion. Fry described him as a hero for as long as I can remember, while Mitchell said the world has been robbed. The former member of 1970s trio The Goodies died on Sunday after contracting coronavirus. Cleese, who met the comedian at Cambridge University and went on to appear with him on stage and screen, said the news meant he had just lost the will to be silly. Tim was a huge part of my early comedy life. We performed together in The West End, on Broadway, and in over 100 I'm Sorry I'll Read that Agains. And then two series of At Last, It's The 1948 ShowHe was a great performer and companion.I have just lost the will to be silly End of Twitter post by @JohnCleese Fry added that Brooke-Taylor was gentle, kind, funny, wise, warm, but piercingly witty when he chose to be. Just heard the devastating news of the death of Tim Brooke-Taylor. A hero for as long as I can remember, and –on a few golden occasions – a colleague and collaborator on I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue. Gentle, kind, funny, wise, warm, but piercingly witty when he chose to be. So sad End of Twitter post by @stephenfry Mitchell, who appeared alongside Brooke-Taylor on BBC Radio 4's panel show I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue, described him as a wonderful comedian and a really lovely man. This is terribly sad news. He was a wonderful comedian and a really lovely man and I feel honoured to have known and worked with him. The world has been robbed - he had years more joy to give. https://t.co/1rnGcYGlfk End of Twitter post by @RealDMitchell The surviving members of The Goodies mourned their co-star. Bill Oddie remembered him as a true visual comic and a great friend, while Graeme Garden said he was terribly saddened by the loss of a dear colleague and close friend of over 50 years. Fifty years and he only got cross with me once... well maybe twice... no quite a lot actually! No one could wear silly costumes or do dangerous stunts like Tim. I know it hurt cos he used to cry a lot. Sorry Timbo. A true visual comic and a great friend x. End of Twitter post by @BillOddie The madcap sketch show began in 1970 and ran for 12 years, bringing the trio prime-time TV success. Brooke-Taylor had previously starred with Garden, Oddie and Cleese, among others, on BBC radio comedy I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again in the 1960s. That later led to Radio 4's long-running I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue. Brooke-Taylor appeared on the first edition in 1972 and remained a regular guest. The show's host Jack Dee said Brooke-Taylor was a delightful man and never anything but great company. He said: Tim brought a unique quality to Clue. He was a proper team player, very generous as a performer, never egotistical and always more than delighted to set himself up as the butt of the joke. For me, his great comedy gift was playing the injured innocent and he did it with brilliance and a characteristic lightness of touch. It's always heartbreaking to lose a loved one, but these times have created the cruellest of circumstances for that to happen in and my thoughts are with his wife Christine and all his family. One of his biggest contributions to British comedy was co-writing and performing the famous Four Yorkshiremen sketch with John Cleese, Chapman and Marty Feldman, originally for the ITV comedy programme At Last The 1948 Show! A host of other figures from comedy and TV paid tribute on social media. So sad to hear that the great Tim Brooke Taylor has died. A wonderful man, so many happy times sat next to him on I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue. Here we are with Barry, Colin and Graeme at a celebration of the show in January. He was on great form. My thoughts are with his family. pic.twitter.com/9CfottzJVe End of Twitter post by @RobBrydon Just devastated at the death of Tim Brooke-Taylor. What a lovely, funny man. He was on such terrific form on the ‘I’m Sorry I Haven’t A Clue’ tour in January. We had such fun. God bless you Tim. So very sad. My love to Christine and his wonderful family. End of Twitter post by @richardosman This is such terribly sad news. Tim was so wonderfully funny, brilliantly skilled and always so charming. Was honoured to have worked with him last year on a reboot of The Goodies. He was as funny, inspiring and delightful as he’d ever been.. https://t.co/bqpjuMNE8X End of Twitter post by @jonculshaw I was obsessed with ‘The Goodies’ as a child, the first comedy show I really loved. I queued up to get the Goodies’ autographs as a grown-up, and got to meet Tim Brooke-Taylor more recently at a party. I was in total awe, but he was so kind & generous. It is so sad he is gone. pic.twitter.com/wxyGpJoyIU End of Twitter post by @davidwalliams Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-34640393,"Obituary: Tim Brooke-Taylor, life of funnyman who co-wrote The Four Yorkshiremen","Tim Brooke-Taylor was at the heart of British comedy for more than six decades - with his words, wit and quickfire japery making millions of people laugh. His comedic roots lay in the Cambridge Footlights, where his contemporaries included John Cleese and the two men he later collaborated with on the TV show The Goodies - Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie. He began his broadcasting career on BBC radio, quickly developing a reputation as a performer and scriptwriter. Probably best known as one of the members of the anarchic Goodies, he was also a long-standing panellist on Radio 4's, I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue. Timothy Julian Brooke-Taylor was born in Buxton, Derbyshire, on 17 Jul 1940. His 59-year-old father was a solicitor and local coroner, who had been wounded in the World War One and was serving in the Home Guard when Tim, his third child was born. I was a mistake, as far as I can gather, Brooke-Taylor later recalled. His father died when he was just 13 and his mother, who was in her 40s at the time, got a job as a school matron. After attending prep school, the young Brooke-Taylor was packed off to Winchester before going up to Pembroke College, Cambridge, to read law. The intention had been that he would enter the family firm but fate intervened when he found himself sharing digs with a fellow student, John Cleese. Membership of the Cambridge Footlights Club brought him into contact with Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie as well as future Python Graham Chapman. None of them had any thought of taking up careers in showbusiness, seeing Footlights as a way of having some fun before facing the world of work. Brooke-Taylor was Footlights president when, in 1963, their revue - originally entitled A Clump of Plinths - went down a storm at the Edinburgh Festival. It opened in the West End later that year before embarking on a tour of Australia and New Zealand, finally ending up on Broadway in 1964. Brooke-Taylor later recalled being taken to a New York nightclub where he encountered the artist, Salvador Dali. I started talking to him about art, he told the Daily Telegraph's Neil Tweedie in 2012, admitting that he soon found himself completely out of his depth. Any thoughts of a career in law swiftly vanished when he began working on a BBC radio show, I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again, which first aired in 1964. Based on the Footlights review and with its roots in early radio comedy shows, such as ITMA and Round the Horne, it paved the way for a host of shows including Monty Python's Flying Circus and The Goodies. Brooke-Taylor both wrote and performed in the sketches, his tour de force being the horrendous Lady Constance de Coverlet, whose piercing screech of Did somebody call? became one of the highlights of the show. He also made an appearance on TV as a regular in the programme, On the Braden Beat, where he played a right-wing businessman giving the audience the benefit of what he thinks is his reasonable point of view. He would later incorporate it into his character in The Goodies. Brooke-Taylor was reunited with Cleese and Chapman on ITV's At Last The 1948 Show, another collection of sketches and quick-fire repartee. The first episode featured The Four Yorkshiremen sketch, co-written by Brooke-Taylor, which would later be revived by the Monty Python team. The four sat round sipping expensive wine remembering when they lived in a paper bag on a rubbish tip or worked 23 hours a day down at mill for a penny every four years. Brooke-Taylor went on to write and perform with Marty Feldman on his comedy show Marty. There was also a brief spell working with Orson Welles on a film entitled One Man Band, but it was never released. He'd seen something on the telly and wanted to work with me for some reason. I spent about 12 days directing him because he didn't trust the actual director. The first episode of The Goodies was aired in 1970 with Brooke-Taylor appearing alongside Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie, in a series that ran for 12 years, the first 10 of them on BBC Two before being bought up by London Weekend Television for ITV. A mixture of sketches, situation comedy and slapstick made use of primitive special effects such as speeded-up filming. The often surreal show saw the three protagonists cycling around on a trandem, trying to do good deeds. Memorable episodes include Kitten Kong, featuring a giant feline toppling the Post Office Tower. A special episode of this show won the Silver Rose at Montreux in 1972. Brooke-Taylor specialised in a character wearing a Union Flag waistcoat, who would often pause the action to deliver patriotic words to a background of Land of Hope and Glory. You've got to have a right wing neo-con loony. Brooke-Taylor said in a 2005 radio interview. And with a name like mine I don't think I can be the revolutionary. The series spawned an unlikely hit record, Funky Gibbon, which the three performed on Top of the Pops. In 1971 he had a short role in the film, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, where he played a computer scientist. A year later he joined the panel of Radio 4's antidote to panel games, I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue, where he would become a regular fixture over the ensuing four decades. He also starred with John Junkin and Barry Cryer in Hello Cheeky, a sketch show which started out on BBC Radio 2 before eventually moving to Yorkshire Television. Together with Graeme Garden he provided voices for the BBC cartoon series Bananaman. Brooke-Taylor popped up in a number of cameo roles over the years in shows including One Foot in the Grave, Heartbeat and Agatha Christie's Marple. In 2013 he appeared in Animal Antics, a spoof news programme in which he was usually upstaged by a man dressed as a dog and his final TV appearance as an actor was in BBC One medical drama Doctors in 2015. In 2011, he and his fellow Goodies star Garden were both appointed as OBEs for services to entertainment. Oddie, the third member of the trio, had been honoured eight years previously for his services to wildlife conservation. After visiting Buckingham Palace to receive the honour from the Prince of Wales, Brooke-Taylor admitted one had to bite one's tongue, having often poked fun at the ease with which honours were handed out in the 1970s. Tim Brooke-Taylor was one of a group of writers and performers who changed the face of British TV and radio comedy, making programmes that have become classics of their time. Essentially a gentle and sensitive man he once admitted leaving his own living room when the weekly results were announced on Strictly Come Dancing, as he couldn't bear seeing anyone thrown off the show."
